#Verse 1
Bm                 Dmaj7
Touch, I remember touch
                    F#m
Pictures came with touch
                  E
A painter in my mind

                  Bm
Tell me what you see
                  Dmaj7
A tourist in a dream
               F#m
A visitor it seems
                  E
A half-forgotten song
             Dmaj7
Where do I belong?
Bm  Bm5-           F#m7
  Tell me what you see

I need something more

#Verse 2
Bm               Dmaj7
Kiss, suddenly alive
           F#m7
Happiness arrive
               E
Hunger like a storm

           Bm
How do I begin?
                 Dmaj7
A room within a room
                 F#m
A door behind a door
                     E
Touch, where do you lead?
                  Dmaj7
I need something more
Bm  Bm5-           F#m7
