Hazy Shade of Winter
Simon and Garfunkel

Pop folk english 70s

#Intro
Dm   C   Bb   Am

#Verse
Dm                             C
Time, time, time, see what's become of me
       Bb
While I looked around
            Am
For my possibilities
         C
I was so hard to please

#Chorus
          Dm                C
But look around, leaves are brown
        Bb        A7            Dm
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

#Verse
                   C
Hear the salvation army band
Bb
Down by the riverside, it's bound to be a better ride
     Am
Than what you've got planned
           C
Carry your cup in your hand

#Chorus
          Dm                    C
And look around you, leaves are brown now
        Bb        A7            Dm
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

#Verse
                C
Hang on to your hopes, my friend
Bb
That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
     Am
Then simply pretend
             C
That you can build them again

#Chorus
     Dm                   C
Look around, the grass is high
               Bb             A7               Dm
The fields are ripe, it's the springtime of my life

#Bridge
Bb                            F
Ahhh, seasons change with the scenery
                  Cadd9
Weaving time in a tapestry
                     Dm D7sus2 Dm
Won't you stop and remember    me

C
  At any convenient time
Bb
Funny how my memory slips while looking over manuscripts
Am
Of unpublished rhyme
            C
Drinking my vodka and lime

#Chorus
       Dm                 C
I look around, leaves are brown now
        Bb        A7            Dm
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

#Outro
      C                 Bb
Look around, leaves are brown
          A7                   Dm
There's a patch of snow on the ground
