# Couplet 1
               C
When the night   has come
<Am
And the land is dark
            F         G7                C
And the moon   is the only light we'll see


           C
No,I won't     be afraid,
      Am
No I won't be afraid
            F               G7          C
Just as long   as you stand,   stand by me

# Refrain
                      C
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
   Am
oh stand by me
    F     G7              C
Oh stand,    stand by me,   stand by me

# Couplet 2
           C
If the sky      that we look upon,
<Am
should tumble and fall
          F              G7           C
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea


            C
I won't cry,     I won't cry,
     Am
No I won't shed a tear
         F            G7             C
Just as long,  as you stand, stand by   me

# Refrain

So, darling, darling, stand by me,
   Am
oh stand by me
    F     G7               C
Oh stand,     stand by me,    stand by me
