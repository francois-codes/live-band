#Verse
          A             Bm7
There's a place in your heart
      C#m             Bm7
And I know that it is love
         A
And this place could be much
Bm7             C#m     Bm7
Brighter than tomorrow

       A          Bm7
And if you really try
            C#m                Bm7
You'll find there's no need to cry
        A
In this place you'll feel
Bm7                C#m    Bm7
There's no hurt or sorrow

#Pre-Chorus
         D        C#m
There are ways to get there
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7
Make a little space
       E
Make a better place

#Chorus
         A
Heal the world
          Bm7
Make it a better place
    D
For you and for me
        A
And the entire human race

E         F#m    C#m
There are people dying
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7              D           A
Make a better place for you and for me

#Instrumental
Bm7     C#m    Bm7

#Verse
       A            Bm7
If you want to know why
          C#m              Bm7
There's a love that cannot lie
        A              Bm7             C#m     Bm7
Love is strong it only cares for joyful giving

      A            Bm7
If we try we shall see
        C#m             Bm7
In this bliss we cannot feel
        A             Bm7
Fear or dread we stop existing
          C#m     Bm7
And start living

#Pre-Chorus
       D           C#m
Then it feels that always
D                    C#m
Love's enough for us growing
          Bm7
So make a better world
       E
Make a better world

#Chorus
         A
Heal the world
          Bm7
Make it a better place
    D
For you and for me
        A
And the entire human race

E         F#m    C#m
There are people dying
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7              D           A
Make a better place for you and for me

#Bridge
        G
And the dream we were conceived in
              A
Will reveal a joyful face
        G
And the world we once believed in
           A
Will shine again in grace

     F#m            C#m
Then why do we keep strangling life
           D                  C#m
Wound this earth crucify this soul
            Bm7
Though it's plain to see
%
This world is heavenly
   D
Be God's glow

#Verse
         A      Bm7
We could fly so high
        C#m           Bm7
Let our spirits never die
      A            Bm7           C#m      Bm7
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers

         A             Bm7
Create a world with no fear
            C#m       Bm7
Together we'll cry happy tears
        A                  Bm7
See the nations turn their swords
     C#m        Bm7
Into plowshares

#Pre-Chorus
        D       C#m
We could really get there
       D                    C#m
If you cared enough for the living
       Bm7
Make a little space
          E
To make a better place
