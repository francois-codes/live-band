#Verse 1
F         Am/E               Adim/Eb
   It's a God-awful small affair
       D                   Gm
To the girl with the mousy hair
        Bb/F             C7
But her mummy is yelling no
                              F
And her daddy has told her to go

        Am/E                     Adim/Eb
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
        D                           Gm
Now she walks through her sunken dream
       Bb/F                   C7
To the seat with the clearest view
          C7
And she's hooked to the silver screen


#Pre-Chorus
Ab/Eb       Eaug                  Fm
    But the film is a saddening bore
          Gb                       Db
For she's lived it ten times or more
          Aaug                    Bbm
She could spit in the eyes of fools
        Db/C
As they ask her to focus on


#Chorus
Bb      Eb
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Gm7     Gbaug                 F
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
Fm                    Cm7
   It's the freakiest show
Ebm7
   Take a look at the
Bb     Eb
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Gm7      Gbaug                F
 Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
Fm                          Cm7
   He's in the best selling show
Ebm7                Gm7   Gbaug   Bb/F   Ebm7b5
   Is there life on Mars?

#Verse 2
F          Am/E                Adim/Eb
  It's on America's tortured brow
            D                    Gm
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
        Bb/F
Now the workers have struck for fame
C7
  'Cause Lennon's on sale again

F         Am/E                       Adim/Eb
  See the mice in their million hordes
      D
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Gm       Bb/F
  Rule Britannia is out of bounds
C7                 C7
  To my mother, my dog, and clowns


#Pre-Chorus
Ab/Eb       Eaug                      Fm
    But the film is a saddening bore
         Gb                          Db
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
      Aaug                  Bbm
It's about to be writ again
     Db/C
As I ask you to focus on


#Chorus
Bb      Eb
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Gm7     Gbaug                 F
Oh man, look at those cavemen go

   It's the freakiest show

   Take a look at the

   Is there life on Mars?
