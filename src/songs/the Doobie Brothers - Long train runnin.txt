Down around the corner half a mile from here

You see them long trains run and you watch 'em disappear

'Cause you know they're runnin' late

Well, pistons keep on churnin'
        Gm7
And the wheels go round and round

       Gm7
In the mountains they go down
        Cm                            Gm7
