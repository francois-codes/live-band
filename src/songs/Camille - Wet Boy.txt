#Intro
| G  D/F#   | Em        | G  D/F#   | Em        |


#Verse 1
| G   D/F#          | Em
   Swim    along the stream along the shore
| G    D/F#       | Em            | Em  G/D
   Seek  between my thighs a hidden fall
| C    D   | G
   Sink and swallow

#Chorus
| C   D  | Em         Bm                        | C  D  | G
   Wet     boy do you know what it feels like to be   wet?

#Verse 2
| G  D/F#        | Em
Crawl against the wind inhale the salt
| G  D/F#      | Em            | Em   G/D
Drown and let it melt inside my throat
| C   D     | G
  Deep  and shallow

#Chorus
| C   D  | Em         Bm                        | C  D  | G
   Wet     boy do you know what it feels like to be   wet?
| C   D  | Em         Bm                        | C  D  | G
  Wet     boy do you know what it feels like to be   wet?

#Bridge
   | C                       D
More water to the world more water to the seas
   | Em                       Bm             | C  D  | G
More water to the ground more water to the child    I carry
   | C                     D
More water to my womb more water to my brow
    | Em                    Bm          | C  D    | G
More water to my eyes more water to the man   I'll marry


#Chorus
| C   D  | Em         Bm                        | C  D  | G
   Wet     boy do you know what it feels like to be   wet?
| C   D  | Em         Bm                        | C  D  | G
  Wet     boy do you know what it feels like to be   wet?
