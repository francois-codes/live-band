#Verse
C#m
Overhead the albatross
      G#m
Hangs motionless upon the air
    F#m
And deep beneath the rolling waves
   G#
In labyrinths of coral caves

    C#m
The echo of a distant time
      G#m
Comes willowing across the sand
    F#m                                G#
And everything is green and submarine

#Chorus
    C#
And no-one showed us to the land
    G#
And no-one knows the wheres or whys
    F#m
But something stirs and something tries
    G#              A
And starts to climb towards the light

#Instrumental
C#m  A  C#m  A  C#m  A  E  B  C


#Verse
C#m
Strangers passing in the street
   G#m
By chance two separate glances meet
    F#m                        G#
And I am you and what I see is me

    C#m
And do I take you by the hand
    G#m
And lead you through the land
    F#m                           G#
And help me understand the best I can

#Chorus
    C#
And no-one calls us to move on
    G#
And no-one forces down our eyes
    F#m
And no-one speaks and no-one tries
    G#            A
And no-one flies around the sun

#Verse
C#m                           G#m
Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
  F#m                       G#
Inviting and inciting me to rise
    C#m
And through the window in the wall
     G#m
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
  F#m                               G#
A million bright ambassadors of morning

#Chorus
    C#
And no-one sings me lullabies
    G#
And no-one makes me close my eyes
F#m
So I throw the windows wide
    G#          A
And call to you across the sky
