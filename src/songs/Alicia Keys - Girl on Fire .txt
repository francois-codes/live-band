#Verse (Keyboard)
A                                 F#m
  She's just a girl, and she's on fire
D                       E
  Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
A                                      F#m
  She's living in a world, and it's on fire
D               A         D                      E
  Filled with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away


#Pre-Chorus (keyboard)
A          F#m                              C#m
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh, she got both feet on the ground
                      E
And she's burning it down
           A          F#m                             C#m
Oh-oh-ooh, ooh, oh-oh-ooh, she got her head in the clouds
                       E
And she's not backing down


#Chorus (tutti)
NC               A
This girl is on fire
F#m                 C#m

  This girl is on fire


#Verse
A                                F#m
  Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
D
  So bright, she can burn your eyes
E
  Better look the other way
A                                         F#m
  You can try but you'll never forget her name
D          A
  She's on top of the world
D                E
  Hottest of the hottest girls say


#Pre-Chorus
A          F#m                            C#m
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh, we got our feet on the ground

And we're burning it down

And we're not coming down

  This girl is on fire


#Bridge
D                            |  E
  Everybody stands, as she goes by
                                        |  D
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
                                  |   E
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
