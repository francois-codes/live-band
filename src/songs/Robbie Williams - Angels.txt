#Couplet 1
             E                           A       A/G#   B
I sit and wait. Does an angel contemplate my fate.
                E                                            A_A/G#   B
And do they know the places were we go when we're grey and old.
                F#m7           A              C#m           A
Cuz I have been told that salvation lets their wings unfold.
             D
So when I'm lying in my bed,
         A/C#
Thoughts running through my head,
      E
And I feel that love is dead.
<D         Asus2/C#      E
I'm loving angels instead.


#Refrain
               B                     C#m
And through it all she offers me protection,
                  A                              E
A lot love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong.
                      B                   C#m
And down the waterfall wherever it may take  me,
                       A
I know that life won't break me.
                   E/G#                F#m
When I come to call,    she won't forsake me.
<D         Asus2/C#      E
I'm loving angels instead.


#Couplet 2
E                                               A            A/G#   B
When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a one way street.
            E                                 A          A/G#   B
I look above and I know I'll always be blessed with love.
    D
And as the feeling grows
         A/C#
she breathes flesh to my bones
    E
And when love is dead,
<D          Asus2/C#      E
I'm loving angels instead.

A lot love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong.
                       B                  C#m
And down the waterfall   wherever it may take me,
                       A
I know that life won't break me.
                    E/G#              F#m
When I come to call,    she won't forsake me.
