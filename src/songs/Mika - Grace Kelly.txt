       |  G
"I wanna talk to you."
        | G                    D/F#       | G
"The last time we talked, Mr. Smith, you reduced me to tears.
  |  G             D/F#  
 I promise you it won't happen again."


#Verse 1
| G
   Do I attract you?
    |  G                  D/F#  | G
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
                       |  G
Am I too dirty? Am I too flirty?

Do I like what you like?

I could be wholesome, I could be loathsome

I guess I'm a little bit shy
                                    | G
Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
N.C.
Without making me try?
