#Verse
              Em7                  Am7
If blood will flow, when flesh and steel are one
B7+5          B7sus4 B7     Esus2   Em
Drying in the colour of the evening sun
           Em7                Am7
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
    B7+5             B7sus4     B7     Esus2   Em
But something in our minds will always stay


#Verse
   Em7                              Am7
Perhaps this final act was meant to clinch a lifetime's argument
     B7+5               B7sus4 B7        Esus2        Em
That nothing comes from vio -  lence and nothing ever could
    Em7                             Am7
For all those born beneath an angry star
     B7+5          B7sus4  B7 Esus2   Em
Lest we forget how fragile we are


#Chorus
C6           B7+5
On and on the rain will fall
     Em
Like tears from a star
     Em
Like tears from a star
C6           B7+5
On and on the rain will say
    Em
How fragile we are
    Em
How fragile we are


#Solo
| Em          | Am7           | B7+5   B7sus4 B7 | Esus2   Em      | (x4)



#Chorus
C6           B7+5
On and on the rain will fall
     Em
Like tears from a star
     Em
Like tears from a star
C6           B7+5
On and on the rain will say
    Em
How fragile we are
    Em
How fragile we are

    Em
How fragile we are
    Em
How fragile we are
