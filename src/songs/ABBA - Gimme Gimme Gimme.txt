# Verse 1
(NC)
Half past twelve
        G
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
      G                               Dm
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Dm   C    Am
Au - tumn winds
        G
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
       G                                Dm
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

No one to hear my pray -  er

# Chorus
Dm          Bb         C         Dm
Gimme gimme gimme a man  after midnight
Bb                 Dm             C           Dm
Won't somebody help  me chase the shadows away
Dm          Bb         C         Dm
Gimme gimme gimme a man  after midnight
Bb                  Dm              C               Dm
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

# Verse 2
Dm   C   Am
Mo - vie stars
G
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
G                                  	    Dm
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Dm    C  Am
Tired of T.V.
G
I open the window and I gaze into the night
G	                                    Dm
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
