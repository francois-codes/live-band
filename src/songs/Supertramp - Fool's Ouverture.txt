Am                  Dm/A
History recalls how great the fall can be
      G7                        Cmaj7
While everybody's sleeping, the boats put out to sea
F                      Bm7b5
borne on the wings of time
              G6                       Am7
It seemed the answers were so easy to find
     Dm7              G7/D
Too late the prophets cry the
             Cmaj7                    | Bb     | %     |
The island's sinking, let's take to the sky

Am                      Dm/A
Called the man a fool, striped him of his pride
G7                         Cmaj7
Everyone was laughing up until the day he died
F                          Bm7b5
 And though the wound went deep
           G6                    Am7
Still he's calling us out of our sleep
     Dm7              G7/D
My friends, we're not alone
            Cmaj7                  | Bb     | %     |
He waits in silence to lead us all home

#Bridge
Dm               Dm6                       Dm7
      So tell me that you find it hard to grow
Dm7       Dm6             Dm
    well I know I know I know
Dm             Dm6                               Dm7
      and you tell me that you've many seeds to sow
Dm7         Dm6          | Bb    | C     |
   well I know I know I know
| G   | F6    | Bb    | C    | Eb    | F    | Ab (NC) |

Give it out, dish it out, let's go crazy, Yeah!"
