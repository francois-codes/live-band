#Chorus
Dm     A7              Dm    D7
I've found a new baby I've found a new girl
                 G7    C7          F    A7
My fashion plate baby got me in a whirl
Dm              A7    Dm            D7
Her new kind of lovin' done made me her slave
G7               C7                    F
Her sweet turtle dovin' is all that I crave

#verse
A7                                   Dm
Sweetest miss with a kiss full o' bliss can't resist somehow
G7                              C7            Bb7 A7
Tells me lies but she's wise naughty eyes mesmerize

#chorus
Dm               A7           Dm
You know I don't mean maybe baby
       D7
I just had to fall
G7          C7         F           A7
And that is why I say swing you dogs

#coda
Dm A7              Dm          D7         G7   
I don't mean maybe I have found a new baby
C7         F
So baby that's all
