    G                    Em
Old Pirates, yes, they rob I.
C             C/B          Am
Sold I to the merchant ships
<G                      Em
Minutes after they took I
<C       C/B      Am
From the bottomless pit.

       G            Em
But my hand was made   strong
<C         C/B          Am
By the hand of the Almighty.

None but ourselves can free our minds.

Have no fear for atomic energy,

Cause none of them can stop the time.

How long shall they kill our prophets
         C      C/B         Am
While we stand aside and look?

Ooh, some say it's just a part of it.

We've got to fulfill the book.
