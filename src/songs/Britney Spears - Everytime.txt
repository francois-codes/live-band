#Intro
| Eb9   | Bb9    | Eb9    | Cm9   |


#Verse
Eb9          Bb9
 Notice     me
Eb9          Cm9
 Take  my  hand
Eb9          Bb9
 Why   are  we
Eb9          Cm9
 strangers when
Gm7            Eb9
 our love is strong?
Gm7            Eb9
 Why  carry  on without me?


#Chorus
(Eb9)               Bb9         Cm9                Gm7
 And everytime I try to fly I fall.  Without my wings,
             Ab9            Fm7
 I feel so small. I guess I need you baby.
Eb9               Bb9            Cm9                Gm7
 And everytime I see you in my dreams, I see your face.
                  Ab9          Fm7
 You're haunting me. I guess I need you baby
| Eb9   | Bb9    | Eb9    | Cm9   |


Eb9             Bb9
 I   make   believe
Eb9             Cm9
 that you are here
Eb9             Bb9
 It's the only way
Eb9             Cm9
 I    see    clear
Gm7             Eb9
 What have I done?
Gm7             Eb9
  You seem to move on easy


#Chorus
(Eb9)               Bb9         Cm9                Gm7
 And everytime I try to fly I fall.  Without my wings,
             Ab9            Fm7
 I feel so small. I guess I need you baby.
Eb9               Bb9            Cm9                Gm7
 And everytime I see you in my dreams, I see your face.
                  Ab9          Fm7
 You're haunting me. I guess I need you baby
 | Eb9   | Bb9    | Eb9    | Cm9   |

Need you, baby.
