G                                             C
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh,
Am                 D7                   G
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.
G                                       C
Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits bright,
     Am           D               D7               G      D7
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight. Oh!

#Chorus
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
C              G
Oh what fun it is to ride
     A7             D7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
C              G
Oh what fun it is to ride
     D7             G
In a one-horse open sleigh

#Verse
  G                                    C
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
    Am              D7                      G
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
    G                                              C
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
   Am         D                D7             G    D7
We ran into a drifted bank and there we got upsot. Oh!

#Chorus
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
C              G
Oh what fun it is to ride
     A7             D7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
C              G
Oh what fun it is to ride
     D7             G
In a one-horse open sleigh

  G                                C
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
   Am              D7                    G
I went out on the snow and on my back I fell
                                          C
A gent was riding by in a one-horse open sleigh
    Am            D              D7                G      D7
He laughed at me as I there lay but quickly drove away.  Oh!

#Chorus
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!

Oh what fun it is to ride
 A7                  D7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 C             G
Oh what fun it is to ride
 D7                  G
In a one-horse open sleigh

#Verse
G                                           C
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Am              D7                           G
Take the girls along and sing this sleighing song
     G                                     C
Just bet a bobtailed bay, two forty as his speed
Am              D               D7                     G     D7
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead. Oh!

#Chorus
G                                  C       G

Oh what fun it is to ride
     A7             D7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
C              G
Oh what fun it is to ride
     D7             G
In a one-horse open sleigh
