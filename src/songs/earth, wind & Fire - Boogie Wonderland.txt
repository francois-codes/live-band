#Verse
 Dm7                             Gm
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
     A7
Who need more than they get
 Dm7                             Gm
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
     A7
Who has laid too many bets

#Verse
 Dm7                          Gm
The mirror stares you in the face
                 A7
And says,"Baby, uh, uh, it don't work"
 Dm7                                   Gm
You say your prayers though you don't care
                         A7
You dance and shake the hurt

Dance, boogie wonderland

Sound fly through the night
    Dm7     Gm              A7
I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
Dm                              Gm        A7
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
Dm                              Gm        A7
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
