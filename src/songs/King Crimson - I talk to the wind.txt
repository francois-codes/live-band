#Intro
| E      | Cmaj7     | Gmaj7     |F#m7    B7  | (2x)


#Verse 1
E                   Cmaj7           Gmaj7               F#m7  B7
Said the straight man, to the late man, "where have you been?"
E                Cmaj7                Gmaj7                F#m7  B7
"I've been here and, I've been there and, I've been in between"

#Chorus
E        Bsus2       E             Bsus2
  I talk to the wind, my words are all carried away
E        Bsus2       Am7              B7      Am7          B7
  I talk to the wind...the wind does not hear...the wind cannot hear

#Verse 2
E               Cmaj7            Gmaj7        F#m7  B7
I'm on the outside, looking inside, what do I see?
E             Cmaj7        Gmaj7        F#m7  B7
Much confusion, disillusion, all around me

#Chorus
E        Bsus2       E             Bsus2
  I talk to the wind, my words are all carried away
E        Bsus2       Am7              B7      Am7          B7
  I talk to the wind...the wind does not hear...the wind cannot hear

#Verse 3
E                   Cmaj7            Gmaj7            F#m7  B7
You don't possess me, don't impress me, just upset my mind
E                Cmaj7          Gmaj7            F#m7  B7
Can't instruct me, or conduct me, just use up my time

#Chorus
E        Bsus2       E             Bsus2
  I talk to the wind, my words are all carried away
E        Bsus2       Am7              B7      Am7          B7
  I talk to the wind...the wind does not hear...the wind cannot hear

#Break

#Chorus
E        Bsus2       E             Bsus2
  I talk to the wind, my words are all carried away
E        Bsus2       Am7              B7      Am7          B7
  I talk to the wind...the wind does not hear...the wind cannot hear

#Verse 4
E                   Cmaj7           Gmaj7               F#m7  B7
Said the straight man, to the late man, "where have you been?"
E                Cmaj7                Gmaj7                F#m7  B7
"I've been here and, I've been there and, I've been in between".......
