#Verse 1
    Fadd9
I'd sit alone and watch your light
   Gm7
My only friend through teenage nights
    Bb
And everything I had to know
  Gm7            Bb F
I heard it on my ra-dio

#Verse 2
    Fadd9
You gave them all those old time stars
        Gm7
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
    Bb
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
    Gm7               Bb F
You made us feel like we could fly.
Gm/F   F
Ra - dio.

#Pre-chorus
   F
So don't become some background noise
  Fm6/Ab
A backdrop for the girls and boys
    Bb
Who just don't know or just don't care
    G7/B
And just complain when you're not there

#Chorus 1
    F/C
You had your time, you had the power
       C7sus4           C7
You've yet to have your finest hour
Bb     F       Gm/F  F
Radio, Radio.

Fadd9          Bb/F  F
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Bb/F  F       Bb/F  F
Radio goo go, Radio ga ga
Fadd9          Bb/F  F
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Bb/F  F
Radio blah blah
Eb            Bb     C
Radio, what's new?
Dm     Csus4 C  Bb/C  C     F
Radio, some-one still loves you!

#Verse 3
   Fadd9
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
   Gm7
On videos for hours and hours
   Bb
We hardly need to use our ears
    Gm7           Bb      Fadd9
How music changes through the years.

#Pre-chorus
      F
Let's hope you never leave old friend
     Fm6/Ab
Like all good things on you we depend
   Bb
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
     G7/B
When we grow tired of all this visual

#Chorus 2
    F/C
You had your time, you had the power
       C7sus4                  C7
You've yet to have your finest hour
Bb   F    Gm/F  F
Ra - dio, (Ra - dio)
    F/C
You had your time, you had the power
       C7sus4           C7
You've yet to have your finest hour
Bb     F       Gm/F  F
Radio, Radio.

Fadd9          Bb/F  F
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Bb/F  F       Bb/F  F
Radio goo go, Radio ga ga
Fadd9          Bb    F
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Bb/F  F
Radio blah blah
Eb            Bb     C
Radio, what's new?
Dm     Csus4 C  Bb/C  C     F
Radio, some-one still loves you!

#Instrumental
F/C
You had your time, you had the power

You've yet to have your finest hour

Ra - dio, (Ra - dio)
