  F                                               (F  Dm  Am  F)
I call you when I need you and my heart's on fire,
    F                                    (F  Dm  Am  F)
you come to me, come to me wild and wired.
            Dm                       Bb
You come to me, Give me everything I need,
F                                                      (F  Dm  Am  F)
You bring a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams,
    F                                                      (F  Dm  Am  F)
you speak the language of love like you know what it means.
                Dm                               Bb      C
And it can't be wrong, take my heart and make it strong.

#chorus
                         F            (F C Bb F)
'Cause you're simply the best,
                        (F C Bb F)
better than all the rest,
            Dm               C      C7
better than anyone, anyone I ever met.
                  F     (F C Bb F)
I'm stuck on your heart,
                              (F C Bb F)
I hang on every word you said,
        Dm                   C             C7
Tear us apart, baby, I would rather be dead.

Deep in your heart I see the start of every night and every day,
F                                              (F  Dm  Am  F)
and in your eyes I get lost, I get washed away.
        Dm                                             Bb            C
Just as long as I'm here in your arms I could be in no better place.

#chorus
                         F            (F C Bb F)
'Cause you're simply the best,
                        (F C Bb F)
better than all the rest,
            Dm               C      C7
better than anyone, anyone I ever met.
                  F     (F C Bb F)
I'm stuck on your heart,
                              (F C Bb F)
I hang on every word you said,
        Dm                   C             C7
Tear us apart, baby, I would rather be dead.

#Bridge
Bb
Each time you leave me I start losing control,
Dm
walking away with my heart and my soul
Bb                                 C                  D
I can feel you even when I'm alone Oh baby, don't let go

#chorus
 D                       G    (G  D  C  G)
'Cause you're simply the best,
                          (G  D  C  G)
better than all the rest,
            Em               D
better than anyone, anyone I ever met.
                  G             (G  D  C  G)
I'm stuck on your heart,
                              (G  D  C  G)
I hang on every word you said,
        Em                   D
Tear us apart, baby, I would rather be dead.
G
You're the best
