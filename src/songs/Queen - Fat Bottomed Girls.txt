I was just a skinny lad, never knew no good from bad
                                      A
But I knew life before I left my nursery  (Huh!)
      D                                G
Left alone with big fat Fanny, she was such a naughty nanny
         D                 A              D    G F D
Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me

#Verse 2
N.C.      D
I've been singing with my band, across the water, across the land
                                        A
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way  (hey)
          D                                    G
But their beauty and their style, went kind of smooth after a while
        D             A            D
Take me to them dirty ladies every time, come on!

#Chorus
D             C              G/B
Ah, won't you take me home tonight?
D          C                  A
Ah, down beside your red fire light
D           G
Ah, and you give it all you got
             D                   A                D
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round
             D                   A                D

Now I got mortgages and homes, I got stiffness in my bones
                                     A
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)
        D
Oh, but I still get my pleasure
      G
Still got my greatest treasure
         D               A                 D
Heap big woman, you done made a big man of me   - Now get this...

Oh (I know) you gonna take me home tonight (Please)
D          C                  A
Oh, down beside that red fire light
D             G
Oh, you gonna let it all hang out

             D                   A                D      G
