It's been a hard day's night
              F                G
and I've been working like a dog
          G      C           G
It's been a hard day's night
            F                 G
I should be sleeping like a log
           C                           D
But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do
             G    C   G
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day
            F                G
to get your money to buy you things
         G                C           G
And it's worth it just to hear you say
             F                 G
You're gonna give me everything
         C                               D
So why I love to come home, cause when I get you alone
              G  C   G
You know I'll be o - kay.
