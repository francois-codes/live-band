#Verse 1
             F
They've been saying
                Dm
"You‘re sophisticated"
           F
They're complaining
       Dm
Overeducated
        F
You are saying
                   Dm
All the words I'm dreaming
             C
Say it after me

Say it after me


#Verse 2
          F
They will blame us
            Dm
Crucify and shame us
         F
We can‘t help it
            Dm
If we are a problem
       F
We are trying
                 Dm
Hard to get your attention

I'm climbing up your wall

Climbing up your wall


#Chorus
Gm
Don‘t go there 'cause you'll never return
           C
I know you think of me when you think of her
             F
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
          Bb
To do the right thing but without recompense
             Gm
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
            C
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
               F
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
             Bb
But then you want me to do the same as you

#Verse 3
          F
You were waitin'
          Dm
For the elevator
         F
You were sayin'
                   Dm
All the things I'm dreaming
        F
No more askin'
