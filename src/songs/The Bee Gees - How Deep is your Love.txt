Eb  Ebmaj7  Abmaj7  Ab/Bb


#Verse 1
             Eb          Gm7    Ab6
I know your eyes in the morning sun
C7         Fm7             G7      Bb7
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
        Eb               Gm7   Cm7
And the moment that you wander far from me
        Fm7                   Bb7
I wanna feel you in my arms again

#Bridge
         Abmaj7           Gm7
Then you come to me on a summer breeze
        Fm7                         Db9
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
         Gm7               Ab/Bb
And it's me you need to show

#Chorus
                Eb
How deep is your love
                          Ebmaj7
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
Abmaj7              Abm6
I really mean to learn
              Eb                    Bbm6               C7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                            Fm7       Abm6            Eb
When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me

#Verse 2
     Gm7    Ab6
I believe in you
C7            Fm7       G7   Bb7
You know the door to my very soul
            Eb           Gm7    Cm7
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
           Fm7             Bb7
You're my saviour when I fall

        Abmaj7           Gm7
And you may not think I care for you
         Fm7                      Db9
When you know down inside that I really do
        Gm7             Ab/Bb
And it's me you need to show,

#Chorus
                Eb
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love

I really mean to learn
              Eb                    Bbm6               C7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                            Fm7       Abm6            Eb
When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me
