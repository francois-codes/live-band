#Intro
D  A  G  A    D  A  G


#Verse
           A
Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky
G
Waiting for me when I die
        A
But between the day you're born and when you die
       G
They never seem to hear even your cry


#Chorus
       F#
So as sure as the sun will shine
           Bm
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
               A                    G                          D
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall, one and all
         A                     G                          D
Ooh the harder they come the harder they'll fall, one and all


#Verse
         A
Well the officers are trying to keep me down
G
Trying to drive me underground
         A
And they think that they have got the battle won
         G
I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done


#Chorus
       F#
So as sure as the sun will shine
           Bm
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
               A                    G                          D
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall, one and all
         A                     G                          D
Ooh the harder they come the harder they'll fall, one and all


#Interlude
D A  G A    D A G       D A G A    D A G
ooh yeah    oh yeah    woh yeah   ooooh


#Verse
      A
And I keep on fighting for the things I want
         G
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
        A
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
           G
Than living as a puppet or a slave


#Chorus
       F#
So as sure as the sun will shine
           Bm
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
               A                    G                          D
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall, one and all
         A                     G                          D
Ooh the harder they come the harder they'll fall, one and all


#Verse
            A                    G                          D
Yeah, the harder they come, the harder they'll fall one and all
                               A    G    D   A   G   D
What I say now, what I say now        awww

What I say now, what I say one time
      A                    G                          D
The harder they come the harder they'll fall one and all
          A                    G                           E
Ooh the harder they come the harder they'll fall one and all
