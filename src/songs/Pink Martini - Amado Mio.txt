#Intro
Dm

#Verse
      Dm   E7       Am
Amado mio, love me forever
        Dm       E7     Am
And let forever, begin tonight
      Dm    E7         Am
Amado mio, when we're together
          Dm           E7       Am
I'm in a dream world, of sweet delight


E7              Am
Many times I've whispered
Dm      Am
"Amado mio",
E7
It was just a phrase
Am
That I heard in plays
E7             Am
I was acting a part.

#Verse
E7             Am
But now when I whisper
Dm     Am
"Amado mio",
E7
Can't you tell I care,
Am
By the feeling there?
E7                      Am
For it comes from my heart


Dm      E7
My one endeavour
           Am
My love, my darling
Dm         E7
Would be to hold you
             Am
And hold you tight
