Call her moonchild
Am6            Fmmaj7/Ab     | Am        Am7   | Am6    Fmmaj7/Ab |
Dancing in the shallows of a river
       Am        Am7

Cob-web strange

Sleeping on the steps of a fountain
Dm7           Em7
Waving silver wands to the

Waiting for the sun on the mountain.

#Verse
        Am        Am7
She's a moonchild
Am6           Fmmaj7/Ab    Am     | Am        Am7   | Am6    Fmmaj7/Ab |
Gathering the flowers in a garden.

Lovely moonchild
Am6             Fmmaj7/Ab     | Am        Am7   | Am6    Fmmaj7/Ab |
Drifting on the echoes of the hours.

#Chorus
Dm7            Em7
Sailing on the wind
      Am   G6  Am
In a milk white gown
Dm7             Em7         Am  Fmaj7
Dropping circle stones on a sun dial
Dm7              Em7
Playing hide and seek
         Am   G6  Am
With the ghosts of dawn
Dm7           Em7          Fmaj7 Am
Waiting for a smile from a sun   child.
