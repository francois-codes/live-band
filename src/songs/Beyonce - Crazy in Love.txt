#Verse 1
Dm7/F  (NC)
I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
NC
I touch on you more and more every time,
Dm7/F  (NC)
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
NC
Call your name two or three times in a row,

Dm7/F  (NC)
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
NC
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
Dm7/F  (NC)
'Cuz I know I don't understand,
NC
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Dm7/F  (NC)
When I talk to my friends so quietly,
NC
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Dm7/F  (NC)
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
NC
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,
Dm7/F  (NC)
The way that you know what I thought I knew,
NC
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
Dm7/F  (NC)
But I still don't understand,
NC
Just how the love you're doing no one else can.
