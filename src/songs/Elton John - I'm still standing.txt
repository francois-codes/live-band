#Intro
| Em    Am7/E|       B7/E|   C   D |  (x2)

#Verse 1
E                      A/E
 You could never know what it's like
       B/E                       E
 your blood like winter freezes just like ice
             F#m7/E                   A/E        B
 and there's cold lonely light that shines from you
          C#m                       A
 you'll wind up like the wreck you hide
             E    F#m/E  E
 behind that mask you____use

#Verse 2
E                                  A/E
 And did you think this fool could never win
       B                     E
 Well, look at me I'm comin' back again
         F#m7/E              A/E    B
 I got a taste of love in a simple way
            C#m                            A
 and if you need to know while I'm still standing,
          E    F#m/E  E
 you just fade a______way

#Chorus
                Em7         Em                   Bm7/D
 Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
                Am9                          Cmaj7     D
 Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin'like a little kid
 Em7         Em            Bm7/D
 I'm still standing after all this time
                Am9           Am7             B7
 Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
 B7#9        Em      Am7        B7
 I'm still standing, yea, yea, yea
 B7#9        Em      Am7        B7     C/B  D
 I'm still standing, yea, yea, yea_____

#Verse 3
E                   A/E
 Once I never could hope to win
     B/E                           E
 you staring down the road leaving me again
     F#m7/E                         A/E    B
 The threats you made were meant to cut me down
            C#m               A
 and if our love was just a circus,
              E   F#m/E  E
 you'd be a clown by_____now

#Chorus
                Em7         Em                   Bm7/D
 Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
                Am9                          Cmaj7     D
 Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin'like a little kid
 Em7         Em            Bm7/D
 I'm still standing after all this time
                Am9           Am7             B7
 Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
 B7#9        Em      Am7        B7
 I'm still standing, yea, yea, yea
 B7#9        Em      Am7         B7     C/B  D
 I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
