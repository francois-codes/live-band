Uptown girl
F#m7                     E/G#
She's been living in her uptown world
A           A/B         E
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
F#m7                  E/G#
I bet her momma never told her why
A         B
I'm gonna try for an

Uptown girl
F#m7                     E/G#
She's been living in her white bread world
A          A/B         E
As long as anyone with hot blood can
F#m7                        E/G#
And now she's looking for a downtown man
A             B
That's what I am

#Verse
C            Am7
And when she knows what
    Dm7            G
She wants from her time
C            Am7
And when she wakes up
    Dm/B         E7
And makes up her mind

A              F#m7
She'll see I'm not so tough
Bm
Just because

I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
F#m7                          E/G#
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
A             A/B          E
She's getting tired of her high class toys
F#m7                          E/G#
And all her presents from her uptown boys
A           B
She's got a choice

Whoo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oh
G            A               F#/A#           B

Uptown girl
F#m7                       E/G#
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
A         A/B             E
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
F#m7                           E/G#
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
A             B
And then I'll win

#chorus
C              Am7
And when she's walking
      Dm7        G
She's looking so fine
C              Am7
And when she's talking
       Dm/B           E7
She'll say that she's mine

A              F#m7
She'll see I'm not so tough
Bm
Just because

I'm in love with an
