#Verse 1
       F        Am     Bb        Am
I see trees of green, red roses too
Gm         F       A7         Dm
I see them bloom, for me and you,
      Db             Gm         C          F    B7   Bb7    C7
And I think to myself, What a wonderful world.

#Verse 2
      F        Am        Bb        Am
I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
Gm                 F        A7           Dm
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
      Db             Gm         C          F   Bb/F    F
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

#Bridge
    C                          F/C
The colours of a rainbow are so pretty in the sky
C                       F
Are also on the faces of people going by
        Dm             Am/E         Dm/F      Am/E
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
Dm             F#°    Gm      C7sus
They’re really saying I love you.

#Verse 4
       F      Am     Bb           Am
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
Gm              F             A7        Dm
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
      Db             Gm      C7              F  Eb9  D9  D7
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

      Gm              C          F      Bb6   F
Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
