#verse
D        G            D
How many roads must a man walk down
           G          D
Before you call him a man?
         D        G           D
Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail
           G             A
Before she sleeps in the sand?
         D        G              D
Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
               G       D
Before they're forever banned?

#chorus
    G          A          D              Bm
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
    G         A              D
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

D        G           D
How many years can a mountain exist
            G             D
Before it's washed to the sea?
         D        G              D
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
               G             A
Before they're allowed to be free?
         D        G           D
Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head,
              G            D
Pretending he just doesn't see?

#chorus
    G          A          D              Bm
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
    G         A              D
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

D        G            D
How many times must a man look up
              G       D
Before he can see the sky?
         D        G         D
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
              G           A
Before he can hear people cry?
         D        G              D
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
              G           D
That too many people have died?

#chorus
    G          A          D              Bm
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
    G         A              D
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
G A D Bm  G A D
