#VERSE
  I never thought that I would find a way out
F#m       D                |   Bm           E  |
 I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
F#m         D                       Bm         E          F#m
 I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
        D         Bm        E       F#m
But God damn, you got me in love again


F#m         D                Bm          E
 I used to think that I was made out of stone
F#m         D             Bm           E
 I used to spend so many nights on my own
F#m       D             Bm       E          F#m
 I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
        D         Bm        E       F#m
But God damn, you got me in love again


#PRE-CHORUS
      D                Bm         E
Show me, your heaven's right here baby
F#m      D            Bm      E
 Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
F#m           D            Bm        E
Never have I ever met somebody like you
F#m          D                 Bm            E
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
F#m        D         Bm        E       F#m
  But God damn, you got me in love again


#CHORUS

  You got me in love again, again


#VERSE

 So many nights my tears fell harder than rain
F#m              D              Bm           E
 Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
F#m          D                Bm        E               F#m
 I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before

But God damn, you got me in love again

 Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy

Never have I ever met somebody like you
F#m          D                 Bm            E
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
F#m        D         Bm        E       F#m
  But God damn, you got me in love again

I finally found someone
             D             Bm
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
                  E              F#m
'Cause you're the one that I want
