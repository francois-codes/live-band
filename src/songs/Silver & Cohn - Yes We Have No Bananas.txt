There's a fruit store on our street, it's run by a Greek
Bb                  Eb      Bb       C                    Bb    NC
And he keeps good things to eat, but you should hear him speak!
Bb               Eb  Bb       F7             Bb   NC
When you ask him anything, he never answers "no".
F                Fdim              C                 F7
He just "yes-es" you to death, and as he takes your dough he tells you

           Bb   Eb          Bb    Bb_Bb_A7_Ab7
We have an old fashioned to-ma-to
Eb             %         Eb_F7
Long Island po-ta-to...
    Bb_NC    Eb        Bb7_A7_G7

We have no bananas today!

Business got so good for him, he wrote home to say:
Bb                 Eb      Bb      C                Bb    NC
"Send me Nick and Jack and Jim; I need help right away."
Bb               Eb      Bb     F7                 Bb   NC
When he got them in the store, there was fun, you bet.
F                  Fdim               C                  F7
Someone asked for sparrow-grass, and then the whole quartet all answered:
