#Verse
         B                              C#m7         F#7
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
         B                                Bm7
Of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to know
            G#m7b5               Gmaj7
And all the people that come and go
             F#7sus4  F#7 F#sus4  F#7
Stop and say hello
       B                         C#m7      F#7
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
           B                                Bm7
The little children laugh at him behind his back
        G#m7b5                 Gmaj7
And the banker never wears a mac
       F#7sus4      F#7 E
In the pouring rain  -  very strange

#Chorus
      A             A/C#           D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
 A                 A/C#           D
There beneath the blue suburban skies
           F#7
I sit, and meanwhile back...

#Verse
         B                               C#m7       F#7
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
           B                           Bm7
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
            G#m7b5               Gmaj7
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
       F#7sus4       F#7  F#7sus4  F#7
It's a clean machine

#Chorus
      A             A/C#           D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
 A                 A/C#           D
There beneath the blue suburban skies
           F#7
I sit, and meanwhile back...

#Verse
           B                          C#7         F#7
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
         B                               Bm7
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
               G#m7b5                 Gmaj7
And though she feels as if she's in a play
       F#7sus4    F#7    F#7sus4    F#7
She is anyway

      B                              C#m7      F#7
Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
           B                            Bm7
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
         G#m7b5         Gmaj7
Then the fireman rushes in
         F#7sus4      F#7 E
From the pouring rain  -  Very strange

#Chorus (x2)
      A             A/C#           D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
 A                 A/C#           D
There beneath the blue suburban skies
           F#7
I sit, and meanwhile back...
