#Verse
  Am
I work all night, I work all day
   E7/G#                     E7            Am
to pay the bills I have to pay, ain't it sad.
    Am
And still there never seems to be
  E7/G#                  E7              Am
a single penny left for me, that's too bad.
                          Am/G  Bb/F   F                 F/E
In my dreams I have a plan,     if I got me a wealthy man
  Dm                                B7/D#                    E7
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball.


#Chorus
Am                   B7              E7       Eaug        Am
Money, money, money,   must be funny   in the rich man's world.
                     B7             E7       Eaug        Am
Money, money, money,   always sunny   in the rich man's world.
   Dm    E7  A7                        Dm
A ha, a ha.    All the things I could do
F7 E Am                  Dm       Eaug        Am    F7
if I had a little money,   it's a rich man's world.
Dm       Eaug        Am
  It's a rich man's world.


#Verse
    Am
A man like that is hard to find
    E7/G#                    E7             Am
but I can't get him off my mind, ain't it sad
    Am
And if he happens to be free
   E7/G#                  E7              Am
I bet he wouldn't fancy me, That's too bad
                       Am/G  Bb/F   F                 F/E
So I must leave, I'll have to go To Las Vegas or Monaco
 Dm                                B7/D#                    E7
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...


#Chorus
Am                   B7              E7       Eaug        Am
Money, money, money,   must be funny   in the rich man's world.
                     B7             E7       Eaug        Am
Money, money, money,   always sunny   in the rich man's world.
   Dm    E7  A7                        Dm
A ha, a ha.    All the things I could do
F7 E Am                  Dm       Eaug        Am    F7
if I had a little money,   it's a rich man's world.
Dm       Eaug        Am
  It's a rich man's world.
