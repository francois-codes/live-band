#Intro
A  F#m  D  E  A


#Verse
A
Every breath you take
               F#m
Every move you make
               D
Every bond you break
               E
Every step you take
                 A *
I'll be watching you

             A
Every single day
                   F#m
And every word you say
               D
Every game you play
                E
Every night you stay
                 A
I'll be watching you

#Chorus
             D                  A
Oh can't you see, you belong to me
                  B7    B                     E
How my poor heart aches,  with every step you take

                   A
And every move you make
                  F#m
And every vow you break
                D
Every smile you fake
                E
Every claim you stake
                 A
I'll be watching you            

#Bridge
F **                                      G
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
                                      F
I dream at night, I can only see your face
                                     G
I look around but it's you I can't replace
                                     F
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
                          A
I keep crying baby, baby, please

#Instrumental
F#m  D  E  F#m

#Chorus
             D                  A
Oh can't you see, you belong to me
                  B7    B                     E
How my poor heart aches,  with every step you take

                 A
Every breath you take
               F#m
Every move you make
               D
Every bond you break
               E
Every step you take
                 A
I'll be watching you

A        F#m       D
 I'll be watching you  
A        F#m       D
 I'll be watching you  
A        F#m       D
 I'll be watching you  
A        F#m       D
 I'll be watching you  
A        F#m       D
 I'll be watching you  
A        F#m       D
 I'll be watching you

 I'll be watching you
