#verse 1
D/G                     G7
    I never knew what a man was supposed to be
C/G                        Cm/G
     I never wanted the responsibility
D/G                            G7
    I still remember what they tried to make of me
C/G                               Cm/C
    They used to wonder what they couldn't get through to me,

       G                      A7/G
'Cauce all that I had as this music
   C/G      G
A-coming to me
                             A7/G
And all that I had was this rhythm
  C/G             G
A-running through me.

#verse 2
D/G                       G7
    I took a tip from the man in the ministry
C/G                      Cm/G
He said, "My son, better work in the factory"
D/G                        G7
Well there were days I can tell you quite honestly
 C/G                  Cm/G
I saw myself winding up in the military

   G                      A7/G
So lucky to have all this music
  C/G       G
A-coming to me
                           A7/G
I'm lucky to have all this rhythm
  C/G             G
A-running through me
                          A7/G
I'm watching the movie go down
   C/G        G
Around, about me
    G                     A7/G
I'm watching the merry-go-round
   C/G        G
Go down about me.

#pre-chorus
         Am7            /B     C6     D7sus4   D7
I said, "Lovers, you're needed in the garden
        Am
'Cauce there's a lot of crazy people
          Am7/B  C6          D7sus4   D7
Who've forgotten where their heart    is
         F            Fmaj7   F6
And they don't give a damn
      C              G                Am
About hurting those flowers and those trees. "

#verse 3
D/G                         G7
Sometimes I wonder where my life is taking me
C/G                             Cm/G
   Sometimes I wonder what they all expect of me
D/G                           G7
   Well there were days I can tell you quite honestly
C/G                     Cm/G
   I saw myself winding up in the monastery

       G                       A7/G
'Cauce all that I have is this music
  C/G       G
A-coming to me
