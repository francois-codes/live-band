Am         G/B
As he came into the window
C          G/B                  G  
It was the sound of a crescendo
Am         G/B
He came into her apartement
C                     G/B            G B
He left the bloodstains on the carpet

Am         G/B
She ran underneath the table
C          G/B              G  
He could see she was unable
Am         G/B
So she ran into the bedroom
C          G/B                      G  
She was struck down, it was her doom
