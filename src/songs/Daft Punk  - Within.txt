#Intro
| Am    | F(add9) | D(sus2) | G     |


#Verse
Am                 F(add9)                  D(sus2)     G
 There are so many things that I don’t understand
Am                      F(add9)            D(sus2)     G
 There’s a world within me that I cannot explain
Am               F(add9)                       D(sus2)     G
 Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
Am                 F(add9)          D(sus2)     G
 I am lost I can’t even remember my name


#Chorus
Am                        F(add9)
 I’ve been, for sometime, looking for someone
Dm
Fighting to know them
G
Please tell me who I am
Am                        F(add9)
 I’ve been, for sometime, looking for someone
Dm
Fighting to know them
G
Please tell me who I am

Am                 F(add9)          D(sus2)     G
