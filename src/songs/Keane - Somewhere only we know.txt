A   AM7/G#   Bm    E


#Verse 1
A              AM7/G#
I walked across an empty land
Bm                          E
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
A               AM7/G#
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Bm                      E
Sat by the river and it made me complete

#Hook
F#m            C#m
Oh simple thing where have you gone
D                          E               
I'm getting old and i need something to rely on
F#m            C#m
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
D                           E
I'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin

#Verse 2
A            AM7/G#
I came across a fallen tree
Bm                        E
I felt the branches of it looking at me
A                AM7/G#
Is this the place we used to love
Bm                               E
Is this the place that i've been dreaming of

#Hook
F#m            C#m
Oh simple thing where have you gone
D                          E               
I'm getting old and i need something to rely on
F#m            C#m
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
D                           E
I'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin

#Bridge
D                 A                E
And if you have a minute why don't we go
D             A              E     
talk about it somewhere only we know
D                 A      E
this could be the end of everything
