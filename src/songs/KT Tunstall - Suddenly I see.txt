    D                    C
Her face is a map of the world

Is a map of the world

It makes you calm she holds
                      D
you captivated in her palm

#Verse 2:
  D                     C
I feel like walking the world
                 D      C  G
Like walking the world
        D                      C

    G              A                 F#m               Bm
She fills up every corner like she's born in black and white
G               A                  F#m         Bm
Makes you fe-el warmer when you're trying to remember
         G
What you heard
    Gm                              D
She likes to leave you hanging on a word

#Bridge:
D             C
 And she's taller than most
D             C          G
 And she's looking at me
D                 C                   D            | C  G  |
 I can see her eyes looking from a page of a magazine
D                   C                      D         C
 Oh she makes me feel like I could be a tower - A big strong tower yeah

#crescendo (x4)
D                      C
 She got the power to be, the power to give,
       D                 C           G
 The power to see yeah yeah (Suddenly I see)

This is what I wanna be
           Bm              F#
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I See)
Bb
Why the hell it
C                Bm             F#
means so much to me (Suddenly I See)
        G            D
