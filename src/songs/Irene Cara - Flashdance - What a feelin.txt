A   E   Bm   F#m      


#Verse 1
A                   E             Bm           F#m
First, when there's nothing but a slow glowing dream
          D             A           G         E
That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind
     A           E            Bm            F#m
All alone I have cried silent tears full of pride
     D             A              G   E
In a world made of steel, made of stone

       A        E               Bm             F#m
Well I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm
      D             A          G  E
Wrap around, take a hold of my heart


#chorus
       F#m  E D  E        F#m  E D
What a feeling,  bein's believin'
E       A       Bm           A/C#     D      E
I can't have it all, now I'm dancin' for my life
          F#m  E D      E       F#m  E D
Take your passion,  and make it happen
E        A     Bm            A/C#        D            E
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life

#instrumental
A   E   Bm   F#m   D   A   G   E


#verse 2
      A        E               Bm         F#m
Now I hear the music, close my eyes, I am rhythm
     D              A          G  E
In a flash it takes hold of my heart

#chorus
       F#m  E D  E        F#m  E D
What a feeling,  bein's believin'
E       A       Bm           A/C#    D      E
I can't have it all, now I'm dancin' for my life
          F#m  E D      E       F#m  E D
Take your passion,  and make it happen
E        A     Bm            A/C#    D          E
Pictures come alive, now I'm dancing through my life

What a feeling (I am music now),  bein's believin' (I am rhythm now)
E        A     Bm            A/C#          D            E
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life
       F#m  E D  E
What a feeling ( I can really have it all)

       F#m        E           D            E
What a feeling (Pictures come alive when I call)
       F#m        E           D            E
I can have it all (I can really have it all)
       F#m        E           D            E
Have it all (Pictures come alive when I call)
       F#m        E           D            E
(call, call, call, call, what a feeling) I can have it all

       F#m        E           D            E
(Being's believin') being's believin'
       F#m        E           D            E
(Take your passion, make it happen) make it happen
       F#m        E           D            E
(What a feeling) what a feeling...
