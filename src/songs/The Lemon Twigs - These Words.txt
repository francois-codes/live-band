#Intro
| A  Asus4  | A Asus4  |

#Verse
| A             | Asus4       | Bm        E   | A
Why do I have to follow you to know just who I am?
| A           | Asus4          | Bm         E     | A
I have enough previous worlds to know which one I'm in

#Chorus
| G#7      | Amaj7 F#m      | Em          | A        |
These Words, these words mean nothing to my soul
| G#7      | Amaj7 F#m      | B7               | A E  |
These words, these words serve only to fill up a hole

#Intro
| A  Asus4  | A Asus4  |

#Verse
| A               | Asus4                  | Bm      E       | D  A
Why can't I float softly down the stream without the violent surf?
| A           | Asus4               | Bm        E     | D  A
If I knew who I was talking about perhaps I'd know my worth

#Chorus
| G#7      | Amaj7 F#m      | Em          | A        |
These Words, these words mean nothing to my soul
| G#7      | Amaj7 F#m      | B7               | A E  |
These words, these words serve only to fill up a hole
