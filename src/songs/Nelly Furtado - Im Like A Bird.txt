#Verse 1
       Bb                     Gm
you're beautiful, that's for sure
        Bb          F
you'll never ever fade
       Bb                       Gm
you're lovely but it's not for sure
     Bb            F
that I won't ever change
                      Eb         F
and though my love is rare-ar-ar-are
                  Eb       F
though my love is true-u-u-ue


#Chorus
Bb                               F
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
                      Cm                             Eb
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is (and baby all I need for you to know is)
Bb                              F
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
                      Cm                              Eb
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is (all I need for you to know is)


#Verse 2
Bb                             Gm
your faith in me brings me to tears,
     Bb               F
even after all these years
       Bb                   Gm
and it pains me so much to tell,
     Bb                      F
that you don't know me that well
                      Eb          F
and though my love is rare-ar-ar-are
                   Eb       F
though my love is true-u-u-ue


#Chorus
Bb                               F
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
                      Cm                             Eb
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is (and baby all I need for you to know is)
Bb                              F
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
                      Cm                              Eb
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is (and baby all I need for you to know is)


#Bridge
      Ebmaj7
it's not that I wanna say goodbye
      Gm
it's just that every time you try
     Ebmaj7           Fsus2
to tell me that you lo-o-ve me
 Ebmaj7                   Gm
each and every single day I know
                                Eb          F            F
I'm going to have to eventually give you away-yeh-yeah


#Interlude
                      Eb         F
and though my love is rare
                      Eb         F
and though my love is true
             Eb                  F
hey I'm just scared
                 Eb              F     F
that we may fall through
