#Verse 1
 Bb                             Cm            F
 Want to play you some of this sweet sweet music
 Bb                             Cm            F
 It's music for happy people better believe it
 Bb                             Cm            F
 If you're feeling lonely may be just sad and blue
 Bb                               Eb       F
 This spicy rhythm is the right think for you

 Cm                        F
 All around the world a message from the islands
 Cm       F                 Eb              F
 Rather play the fool than suffer on in silence

#Chorus
 Bb       Gm   Cm   F       | Bb     Gm  | Cm   F  |
 Dance, Soca dance    soca dance
 Bb       Gm   Cm   F       | Bb     Gm  | Cm   F  |
 Dance, soca dance do the soca dance

#Verse 2
 Bb                             Cm            F
 Want to play you some of this soca beat
 Bb                             Cm            F
 This Caribbean rhythm will put you on your feet
 Bb                             Cm            F
 Whether you're young, whether you're old and grey
 Bb                               Eb       F
 Gather around, we'll Jam it night and day

 Cm                        F
 All along the beach, a party in the moonlight
 Cm       F                 Eb              F
 With Soca sounds to make the feelings of the tune right...

#Chorus
 Bb       Gm   Cm   F       | Bb     Gm  | Cm   F  |
 Dance, Soca dance    soca dance
 Bb       Gm   Cm   F       | Bb     Gm  | Cm   F  |
 Dance, soca dance do the soca dance
