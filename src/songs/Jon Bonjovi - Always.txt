#Intro
E    A    C#m   B   A


#Verse 1
C#m
this romeo is bleeding
B
but you can't see his blood
A
it's nothing but some feelings
          C#m              B
that this old dog kicked up

C#m
it's been raining since you left me
          B
now I'm drowning in the flood
A
you see I've always been a fighter
       B               A B C#m
but without you I give up

C#m
now I can't sing a love song
          B
like the way it's meant to be
A
well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
     B                 A B
but baby, that's just me


#Chorus
E             B
yeah, I will love you
A      C#m   B
baby  Always
E               B                   A
and I'll be there forever and a day
C#m   B
Always

E
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
             B
till the heavens burst and
%
the words don't rhyme
            A
and I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
          B
and I'll love you
A B  C#m
Always


#Verse 2
C#m
now you're pictures that you left behind
B
are just memories of a different life
A
some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
                C#m                B
one that made you have to say goodbye

C#m
what I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
              B
to touch your lips, to hold you near
A
when you say your prayers try to understand
          B                     A  B  C#m
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

C#m
when he holds you close, when he pulls you near
                 B
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
A
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
               B                 A  B
to say to you till the end of time

#Chorus
E            B           A
yeah, I will love you baby
C#m   B
Always
E                   B               A
and I'll be there forever and a day
C#m   B
Always

#Bridge
D                  G
if you told me to cry for you
A     B
I could
                   G         A
if you told me to die for you
    B
I would
         A           G
take a look at my face
                           A
there's no price I won't pay
%
to say these words to you

A
well, there ain't no luck

in these loaded dice
      B
but baby if you give me just one more try

we'll find a place where the sun still shines
