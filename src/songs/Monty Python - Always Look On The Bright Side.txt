#Verse
     Am                 D             G               Em
Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad
      Am                   D         G
Other things just make you swear and curse
            Am                D
When you're chewing on life's gristle
      G               Em
Don't grumble, give a whistle
    A7                                   D7
And this'll help things turn out for the best


#Chorus
    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
   G   Em          Am    D7      G     Em    Am    D7
Always look on the light side of life


#Verse
   Am               D               G                Em
If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten
              Am                  D         G
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
            Am             D               G     Em
When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly chumps
     A7                                       D7
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing


#Chorus
    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
            G   Em          Am    D7        G     Em    Am    D7
Come on, always look on the bright side of life


#Verse
     Am               D        G               Em
For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
         Am              D              G
You must always face the curtain with a bow
   Am             D              G          Em
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
  A7                                D7
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.


#Chorus
    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7
So always look on the bright side of death
G      Em       Am           D7    G         Em    Am    D7
Just before you draw your terminal breath


#Verse
Am                D    G                Em
Life's a piece of shit when you look at it
Am                 D                    G
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
       Am             D
You'll see it's all a show,
         G               Em
keep 'em laughing as you go
       A7                               D7
Just remember that the last laugh is on you


#Chorus
    G      Em          Am     D7      G     Em    Am    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
G      Em          Am    D7      G      Em    Am    D7
Always look on the right side of life (Come on guys, cheer up)

A      F#m         Bm     E7      A     F#m   Bm    E7
