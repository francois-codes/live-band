D               Bm           F#m           G             x2
Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do, do do do do
D               Bm           F#m           G             x2


#Verse 1
D    Bm                 F#m         G               D
Understand the things I say, don't turn away from me
D             Bm               F#m         G               D
Cause I spent half my life out there, you wouldn't disagree
D           Bm                   F#m               G                  D
D'you see me, d'you see, do you like me, do you like me standing there
D           Bm                   F#m             G                      D
D'you notice, d'you know, do you see me, do you see me, does anyone care

#Chorus 1
D       Bm                F#m                  G                 D
Unhappiness, where's when I was young, and we didn't give a damn
D              Bm             F#m              G                D
'Cause we were raised, to see life as fun and take it if we can
D        Bm                F#m             G                           D
My mother, my mother she’d hold me, she’d hold me, when I was out there
D        Bm              F#m              G                        D
My father, my father, he liked me, oh he liked me, does anyone care

#Verse 2
D    Bm                 F#m         G               D
Understand what I've become, it wasn't my design
D             Bm               F#m         G               D
And people everywhere think some-thing better than I am
D           Bm                   F#m               G                  D
But I miss you, I miss 'cause I liked it, 'cause I liked it, when I was out here
D           Bm                   F#m             G                      D
D'you know this, d'you know, you did not find me, you did not find, does anyone care

#Chorus 2
D       Bm                F#m                  G                 D
Unhappiness, where's when I was young, and we didn't give a damn
D              Bm             F#m              G                D
'Cause we were raised, to see life as fun and take it if we can
D        Bm                F#m             G                           D
My mother, my mother she’d hold me, she’d hold me, when I was out there
D        Bm              F#m              G                        D
My father, my father, he liked me, oh he liked me, does anyone care

#Outro
D               Bm                 F#m                G
  Does anyone care, does anyone care,
F#m               G
 Does anyone care, does anyone care,
D               Bm           F#m           G             x2
Do do do do (adlib)
