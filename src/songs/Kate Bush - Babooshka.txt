#Verse
Dm
 She wanted to test her husband
G7sus4/C    Bb6           D/F#
 She knew exactly what to do
  Bbmaj7       Am7
A pseudonym to fool him
Gm7           C/E         D/F#
 She couldn't have made a worse move

#Verse
Dm
 She sent him scented letters
G7sus4/C  Bb6                D/F#
 And he received them with a strange delight
Bbmaj7    Am7
Just like his wife
Gm7          C/E            D/F#
 But how she was before the tears

#Bridge
Gm7          C/E            D/F#
 And how she was before the years flew by
Gm7          C/E             # G7sus4
 And how she was when she was beautiful
| G7sus4    G7sus4/A   | G7sus4/Bb      |
                            She signed the letter

#Chorus
Dm  Csus4/E
All yours
  Gm7        D/F#       Gm7
Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya
Dm  Csus4/E
All yours
  Gm7        D/F#      # Gm
Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya

#Interlude
| Gm C/E  | D/F#  |

| Gm C/E  | D/F#  |
             Babooshka

#Verse
Dm
 She wanted to take it further
G7sus4/C  Bb6               D/F#
 So she arranged a place to go
Bbmaj7 Am7
To see if he
Gm7              C/E          D/F#
 Would fall(-uh) for her incognito

#Verse
Dm
 And when he laid eyes on her
G7sus4/C    Bb6              D/F#
 He got the feeling they had met before
  Bbmaj7  Am7
Uncanny   how she
Gm7          C/E           D/F#
 Reminds him of his little lady

#Bridge
Gm7    C/E            D/F#
 Capacity to give him all he needs
Gm7            C/E             D/F#
 Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Gm7            C/E             # G7sus4
 Just like his wife when she was beautiful
| G7sus4    G7sus4/A   | G7sus4/Bb   |
                            He shouted out

#Chorus
    Dm  Csus4/E
I'm all yours
  Gm7        D/F#       Gm7
Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya
Dm  Csus4/E
All yours
  Gm7        D/F#       Gm7
Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya
Dm  Csus4/E
All yours
  Gm7        D/F#       Gm7
Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya
