#Intro
N.C.                                          Bm E A
Come on Harry, we wanna say "Goodnight" to you


#Verse 1
D
Holdin' me back
          Bm
Gravity's holdin' me back
              E
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
             A
Why don't we leave it at that?

D
Nothin' to say
               Bm
And everything gets in the way
             E
Seems you cannot be replaced
            A
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh


#Chorus
D              Bm             E
  In this world, it's just us
    A                            D
You know it's not the same as it was
             Bm             E
In this world, it's just us
    A                            D
You know it's not the same as it was
      Bm         E
As it was, as it was
    A
You know it's not the same


#Verse 2
D
Answer the phone,
               Bm
"Harry, you're no good alone
            E
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
           A
What kinda pills are you on?"

D
Ringin' the bell
             Bm
And nobody's coming to help
           E
Your daddy lives by himself
                 A
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh


#Chorus
D              Bm             E
  In this world, it's just us
    A                            D
You know it's not the same as it was
             Bm             E
In this world, it's just us
    A                            D
You know it's not the same as it was
      Bm         E
As it was, as it was
    A
You know it's not the same


#Bridge
D
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
Bm
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
E
Leave America, two kids, follow her
A
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first


#Outro
      Bm E
(Hey!)
      A
As it was
    D                            Bm
You know it's not the same as it was
      E          A
As it was, as it was
