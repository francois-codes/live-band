#Verse 1
              C
It's a human sign
F               Dm7
When things go wrong
G                     C
When the scent of her lingers
F                 Dm7
And temptation's strong

G           Am
Into the boundary
F               G
Of each married man
                    Am
Sweet deceit comes calling
F               G
And negativity lands


#Chorus
           C
Cold cold heart
F            Dm7
Hard done by you
G                 C
Some things look better baby
F             Gsus4
Just passing through

G            C
And it's no sacrifice
               F
Just a simple word
                 G
It's two hearts living
                 C
In two separate worlds
             C
But it's no sacrifice
    Dm7
No sacrifice
        Em     F  G   C
It's no sacrifice at all

#Verse 2
C               F
Mutual misunderstanding
          Dm7
After the fact
G           C
Sensitivity builds a prison
F            Dm7
In the final act

G          Am
We lose direction
F          G
No stone unturned
            Am
No tears to damn you
F             G
When jealousy burns


#Chorus
           C
Cold cold heart
F            Dm7
Hard done by you
G                 C
Some things look better baby
F             Gsus4
Just passing through

G            C
And it's no sacrifice
               F
Just a simple word
                 G
It's two hearts living
                 C
In two separate worlds
             C
But it's no sacrifice
    Dm7
No sacrifice
        Em     F  G  C  Em7  F
It's no sacrifice at all

#Chorus

Hard done by you

Some things look better baby

Just passing through

G            C
And it's no sacrifice
               F

No sacrifice at all

No sacrifice at all
   G            C   F  Dm7
No sacrifice at all
