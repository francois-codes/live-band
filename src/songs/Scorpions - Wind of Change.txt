#Intro
F Dm  F Dm  Am Dm Am G


#Verse 1
C                Dm
I follow the Moskva,
              C
down to Gorky Park,
                 Dm      Am  G
listening to the wind of change
C                Dm
An August summer night,
                 C
soldiers passing by,
                 Dm      Am  G
listening to the wind of change

#Instrumental
F Dm  F Dm  Am Dm Am G


#Verse 2
C                    Dm
The world is closing in,
             C
did you ever think,
                    Dm          Am    G
that we could be so close, like brothers?
C                   Dm
The future's in the air,
                   C
I can feel it everywhere,
                 Dm      Am  G   G
blowing with the wind of change

#Chorus 1
C    G          Dm           G7
Take me, to the magic of the moment,
     C     G
on a glory night,
          Dm            G             Am
where the children of tomorrow dream away, (dream away)
F              G
in the wind of change
C     C


#Verse 3
C                Dm
Walking down the street,
             C
distant memories,
                  Dm       Am G
are buried in the past, forever
C                Dm
I follow the Moskva,
              C
down to Gorky Park,
                 Dm      Am  G    G
listening to the wind of change

#Chorus 2
C    G          Dm           G7
Take me, to the magic of the moment,
     C     G
on a glory night,
          Dm            G                  Am
where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
F            G
with you and me

#Chorus 1
C    G          Dm           G7
Take me, to the magic of the moment,
     C     G
on a glory night,
          Dm            G             Am
where the children of tomorrow dream away, (dream away)
F              G
in the wind of change

#Bridge
Am                       G
The wind of change blows straight,
                 Am
into the face of time
                            G
Like a storm wind that will ring,
                              C
the freedom bell for peace of mind
                   Dm
Let your balalaika sing,
                        E7
what my guitar wants to say

#Chorus 2
C    G          Dm           G7
Take me, to the magic of the moment,
     C     G
on a glory night,
          Dm            G                  Am
where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
F            G
with you and me

#Chorus 1
C    G          Dm           G7

on a glory night,
          Dm            G             Am
where the children of tomorrow dream away, (dream away)
F              G      G   G   G
in the wind of change
