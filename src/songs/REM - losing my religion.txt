# Couplet 1
    Am
Oh, life is bigger
<Em
It's bigger than you
              Am
And you are not me.
                           Em
The lengths that I will go    to,
                          Am
The distance in your eyes,
<Em                       Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
            G
I set it up.

# Refrain
                   Am
That's me in the corner,
                  Em
That's me in the spotlight
             Am
Losing my religion.
               Em
Trying to keep    up with you.
        Am
And I don't know if I can do it.
<Em                      Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
                      G
I haven't said enough.

I thought that I heard you laughing,
  Dm             G            Am
I thought that I heard you sing.
   F                 Dm   G    Am  G
I  think I thought I saw you try.

# Couplet 2
        Am                       Em
Every whisper of every waking hour
                     Am
I'm choosing my confessions,
             Em
Trying to keep an eye on you
          Am                           Em
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
                       Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
            G
I set it up.

# Couplet 3
              Am
Consider this,    consider this,
    Em
The hint of a century,
              Am
Consider this:   the slip
     Em
That brought me to my knees failed.
Am
What if all these fantasies
     Em
Come    flailing around?
         Dm            G
Now I've said too much.

I  think I thought I saw you try.

    C               Dm
But that was just a dream,
C               Dm
That was just a dream.

Try, cry,   why,   try.

That was just a dream,    just a dream, just a dream, dream.
