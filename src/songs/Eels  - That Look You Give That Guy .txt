#Intro
| F  F/E  | Eb  D  | Gm  Gm/F  | C7/E  C7  |

| F  F/E  | Eb  D  | Gm  Gm/F  | C7/E  C7  |


#Verse 1
F          F/E                  Eb          D
   I never thought that I could be so bold
Gm        Gm/F               C7/E     C7
  To even say these thoughts aloud
F            F/E                 Eb               D
   I see you with your man, your eyes just shine
Gm                Gm/F             C7/E     C7
  While he stands tall and walking proud


#Chorus
F             F/E       Eb    D     Gm
That look you give that guy I wanna see
Gm/F             C7/E     C7
Looking right at me
F          F/E     Eb    D        Gm
If I could be that guy instead of me
    Gm/F          C7/E     C7
I'd never let you down


#Verse 2
F           F/E                Eb             D
  It always seems like you're going somewhere
Gm       Gm/F               C7/E     C7
  Better than you've been before
F               F/E         Eb              D
  While I go to sleep and I dream all night
Gm       Gm/F           C7/E     C7
  Of you knocking at my door


#Chorus
F             F/E       Eb    D     Gm
That look you give that guy I wanna see
Gm/F             C7/E     C7
Looking right at me
F          F/E     Eb    D        Gm
If I could be that guy instead of me
    Gm/F         C7/E    C7           F
I'd be all I can be, I'd be all I can be


#Interlude
| F  Fmaj7/A  |  Eb/Bb   D/A  | Gm  Gm/Bb   | C7       |

| F  Fmaj7/A  |  Eb/Bb   D/A  | Gm  Gm/F    | C7/E  C7 |


#Verse 3
F              F/E          Eb          D
  I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
Gm            Gm/F             C7/E     C7
  I'm nothing much I know it's true
F            F/E           Eb          D
  I lack the style and the pedigree
Gm       Gm/F           C7/E     C7
  And my chances are so few


#Chorus
F             F/E       Eb    D     Gm
That look you give that guy I wanna see
Gm/F             C7/E     C7
Looking right at me
F          F/E     Eb    D        Gm
If I could be that guy instead of me
    Gm/F           C7/E   C7           F
I'd give you all I got


#Verse 4
F          F/E                  Eb          D
   I never thought that I could be so bold
Gm        Gm/F               C7/E     C7
  To even say these thoughts aloud
F               F/E     Eb               D
  But if, let's say, it won't work out
Gm         Gm/F           C7/E     C7
  You know where I can be found


#Chorus
F             F/E       Eb    D     Gm
That look you give that guy I wanna see
Gm/F             C7/E     C7
Looking right at me
F          F/E     Eb    D        Gm
If I could be that guy instead of me
    Gm/F          C7/E      C7
I'd never let you down, I'd never let you down
