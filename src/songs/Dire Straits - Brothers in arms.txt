#Verse 1
                     E       F#
These mist covered mountains
                 B   Bsus4  B
Are home now for me
        D#m/A#       G#m     D#m
But my home is the low lands
                E       F#sus4
And always will be
     F#         G#m     D#m
Someday you'll return to
                      E      C#m7   F#sus4
Your valleys and your farms
           F#        G#m
And you'll no longer burn
      E         F#sus4   F#
To be brothers in arms

#Verse 2
              F#        E       F#
Through these fields of destruction
             B   Bsus4 B
Baptisms of fire
      D#m/A#        G#m      D#m
I've witnessed your suffering
                      E       F#sus4   F#
As the battle raged higher
                    G#m         D#m
And though they did hurt me so bad
                  E     C#m     F#sus4
In the fear and alarm
    F#       G#m
You did not desert me
      E        F#sus4  F#
My brothers in arms

#Verse 3
           F#              G#m      B    F#
There's so many different worlds
   B               E     F#
So many different suns
    F#               G#m     B   F#
And we have just one world
        B                E      E
But we live in different ones

#Verse 4
        F#            E      F#
Now the sun's gone to hell   and
                  B   Bsus4   B
The moon's riding high
       D#m/A#      G#m    D#m
Let me bid you farewell
                 E      F#
Every man has to die
                         G#m      D#m
But it's written in the starlight
                        E    C#m    F#sus4
And every line in your palm
        F#           G#m
We're fools to make war
        E           F#sus4  F#
On our brothers in arms
