Look at this trove, treasures untold
|Bb                   C/Bb
How many wonders can one cavern hold?

I want more


#Chorus 1
|F                   Am7
I wanna be where the people are

I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
|Dm                        Am
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em?
     |Bb/C      C      C7
Oh - feet!
|F                            F/A
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
|Bb                   Bb/C         C
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
|Dm                   Am  F/A                    |Bb/C
Strolling along down a - what's that word again?
        C7
Street
             |F                   F/Eb
Up where they walk, up where they run
             |Bb/D                     Bbm/Db
Up where they stay all day in the sun
          |F/C                 Bb/C
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
C            |F (3/4)
Part of that world


#Verse 2
            |Bb              C/Bb                |Am       Dm
What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
             |Bb            C/Bb              |Am    F7sus4
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
F7         |Bb            C/Bb
Bet'cha on land they understand
               |A7sus4   A7          Dm      Dm/C
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters   
             |F/G    G          F/G
Bright young women      sick of swimmin'
G        |Ebmaj7                Bb/C  C      Bb/C  C
Ready to stand


#Chorus 2
    |F                      F/A
And ready to know what the people know
|Fsus4                   Bb/C     C7
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
|Dm               Am           F/A
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?
|Gm7     C7
Burn?
             |F
When's it my turn?
           F/Eb           |Bb/D                Bbm/Db  N.C.
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?

#Outro
           |Fsus4
Out of the sea
             |Bb/C   C7
Wish I could be
            |Bb         C/Bb   |Bb     C/Bb  |F
Part of that world
