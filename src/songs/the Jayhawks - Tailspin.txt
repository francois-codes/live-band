#verse
          D                     F#m
Well they stood prepared as you took the chair
             G            D
There was no need to satisfy you
D                       F#m
I'll be damned though I held your hand
            G            A7
They felt a need to crucify you

             Bm         F#m
You're going down, baby baby
             G          A7
You're going down, baby baby

#chorus
            D        F#m Gmaj7               D
You're in a tailspin---- running out of your head (2x)

#verse
         D                     F#m
You're a fragile flower in its final hour
        G                   D
With no chance to taste the waters
D                           F#m
Judge declared  "you'll get fifteen years
         G               A7
Join the lonely sons and daughters"

             Bm        F#m
You're going down baby baby
             G         A7
You're going down baby baby

#Chorus
            D       F#m  Gmaj7               D
You're in a tailspin---- running out of your head (2x)

D                          F#m
Smoke and mirrors couldn't hide your tears
     G             D
Your eyes only betray you
D             F#m
Long trip you lost your grip
      G                A7
We've all been praying for you

             Bm        F#m
You're going down baby baby

You're going down baby baby
