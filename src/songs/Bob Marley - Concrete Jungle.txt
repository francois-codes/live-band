No sun will shine in my day today (no sun will shine)
                Am                     D
The high yellow moon won't come out to play (that high yellow moon won't come out to play)
       C                                  Em
I said (darkness) darkness has covered my light
C                                        Em
(And has changed) and has changed my day into night, yeah

G                       D
Where is the love to be found? (oh-oh-oh) Won't someone tell me?
       Em                            Am           Em
'Cause life (sweet life) must be somewhere to be found (must be somewhere for me)

But I'm not free, oh-ooh!
            Am                   D
I know I am bound here in captivity;

G'yeah, now (never, never) I've never known happiness;
              C                            Em      
(never, never) I've never known what sweet bless is

G                                     D
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown; Won't someone help me?
       Em         
'Cause I (sweet life)
            Am                       Em
I've got to pick myself from off the ground
