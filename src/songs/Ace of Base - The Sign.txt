#Verse 1
|G         Em
I, I gotta new life,
           |C          D              |G
You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad
             Em    |C       D           |G
How could a person like me care for you?
         Em           |C             D          |G
Why do I bother when you're not the one for me?
     Am      |D
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh   Is enough enough?

#Chorus
|G          Em       |C            D              |G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
          Em      |C          D
Life is demanding without understanding
|G         Em         |C            D               |G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
               Em                 |C                    D        |C
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
     D
But where do you belong?

#Verse 2
|G         Em
Under the pale moon
      |C            D               |G
For so many years I wondered who you are
            Em    |C        D         |G
How could a person like you bring me joy?
          Em             |C       D          |G
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars
     Am      |D
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh  Is enough enough?

#Chorus
|G         Em        |C            D              |G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
          Em      |C           D
Life is demanding without understanding
|G          Em        |C            D              |G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
               Em                 |C                    D       | C
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
     D
But where do you belong?

I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
        |G                    Em
And I am happy now living without you
    |C          D
I've left you, oh, oh, oh,oh
|G         Em         |C            D                  |G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign

No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong

|G         Em      C        D

|G         Em      C        D                 C

|G         Em          |C            D          |N.C.
