Up in the club, we just broke up
%
I'm doing my own little thing
%
You decided to dip but now you wanna trip
%
'Cuz another brother noticed me

%
I'm up on him, he up on me
%
Don't pay him any attention
%
Kept crying my tears, for three good years
%
Ya can't be mad at me


#Bridge
Em
'Cuz if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
%
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
%
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
%
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
%
Oh, oh, oh #8x

#Chorus
                      Bm        C
'Cuz If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
        Bm                 Am
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
         Bm            C
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
        Bm                 Am                         E
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it


#Verse
Em
I put gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
%
Hold me tighter than my Dereon jeans
%
Acting up, drank in my cup
%
I could care less what you think

%
I need no permission, did I mention
%
Don't pay him any attention
%
'Cuz you had your turn but now you gonna learn
%
What it really feels like to miss me


#Bridge
Em
'Cuz if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
%
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
%
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
%
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Oh, oh, oh #8x

#Chorus
                      Bm        C
'Cuz If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
        Bm                 Am
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
         Bm            C
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
        Bm                 Am                         Em
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Em
Oh, oh, oh #8x

#Verse
 Am                      Bm    Em
Don't treat me to these things of this world
     Am
I'm not that kind of girl
      Bm      Em                     Am                
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
                 Bm   Em
He's a man that makes me and takes me
      Am                          D#dim
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond

D#dim
Pull me into your arms
%
Say I'm the one you own
%
If you don't, you'll be alone
%
And like a ghost I'll be gone

Now put your hands up

        Bm                 Am
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
         Bm            C
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
        Bm                 Am                         E
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
