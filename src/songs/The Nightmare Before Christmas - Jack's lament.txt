Dbm
Well, well, well, what have we here? Sandy Claws, huh?
  A7 Ab7        Dbm Cm
Oh, I'm really scared
Bbm  Em Dbm                              Em     Ab/C
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

#Verse 1
        Ebm
You're jokin', you're jokin'
   Abm             Bb
I can't believe my eyes
        Ebm
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
     B                  Bb
This can't be the right guy

#Pre-Chorus 1
     Abm
He's ancient, he's ugly
  Em
I don't know which is worse
  Ebm   N.C.
I might just split a seam now
N.C                      Ab
If I don't die laughing first

#Chorus 1
     Cm
When Mr. Oogie Boogie says there's trouble close at hand
                                      Ab7     G7      Cm
You'd better pay attention now 'Cause I'm the Boogie Man
    Fm                         Cm
And if you aren't shakin' there's something very wrong
                                               Ab7     G7      Cm
'Cause this may be the last time now that you hear the boogie song, ohhh

#Post-Chorus
Dm/F
Ohhh (Ohhh)
Cm
Ohhh (Ohhh)
Dm/F
Ohhh (Ohhh)
               Cm    Dm     Cm
Ohhh, he's the Oogie Boogie Man

#Bridge
Dbm
Release me now or you must face the dire consequences
                                   A7      Ab7        Dbm Cm
The children are expecting me so please, come to your senses

#Verse 2
        Ebm
You're jokin', you're jokin'
   Abm             Bb
I can't believe my ears
     Ebm
Would someone shut this fella up
     B              Bb
I'm drownin' in my tears

#Pre-Chorus 2
     Abm
It's funny, I'm laughing
     Em
You really are too much
    Ebm  N.C.
And now, with your permission
N.C
I'm going to do my stuff
N.C
What are you going to do?
N.C.
I'm gonna do the best I can

#Chorus 2
        Dm
Oh, the sound of rollin' dice to me is music in the air
                                     Bb7     A7         Dm
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man although I don't play fair
Gm                                      Dm
It's much more fun, I must confess when lives are on the line
                                             Bb7     A7        Dm
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy now that'd be just fine

#Outro
Ebm                                  B7 Bb7          Ebm Dm
Release me fast or you will have to answer for this heinous act

    Fm
Oh, brother, you're something
    Bbm           C
You put me in a spin
   Fm
You aren't comprehending
      Db                 C
The position that you're in
     Bbm
It's hopeless, you're finished
     Gbm           Dm/F
You haven't got a prayer
          Ebm/Gb
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
    Bb                  Ebm
And you ain't going nowhere
