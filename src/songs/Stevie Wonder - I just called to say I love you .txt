#Verse 1
C                  G      C     G
No New Year's day, to celebrate,
             C                             Dm7+
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away.
            Dm      Dm7+       Dm Dm7+                   
No first of spring, no song to sing,
        Dm                  G        C
in fact here's just another ordinary day.

C                 G       C    G                   
No April rain, no flowers bloom,
           C                            Dm  Dm7+
no wedding Saturday within the month of June.
            Dm  Dm7+         Dm  Dm7+                  
But what it is, is something true,
           Dm                     G             C    NC
made up of these three words that I must say to you.

#Chorus
       Dm        G     C              
I just called to say I love you,
       F         G              Am
I just called to say how much I care.
       Dm        G     C                       
I just called to say I love you,
      F                G            C
and I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

#Verse 2
            C     G       C  G
No summer's high, no warm July,
           C                               Dm  Dm7+
no harvest moon to light one tender August night.
          Dm      Dm7+       Dm    Dm7+
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,
         Dm                G               C
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.

         C    G        C  G                 
No Libra Sun, no Halloween,
          C                                   Dm   Dm7+
no giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
            Dm  Dm7+           Dm  Dm7+
But what it is, though old, so new.
             Dm                  G                C
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do.

#Chorus (change Key)
       F#         G#    C#
I just called, to say I love you.
       F#         G#             Bbm
I just called, to say how much I care.
       F#         G#    Bbm
I just called, to say I love you.
      F#               G#           C#
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

#Chorus (change Key)
       G          A     D
I just called, to say I love you.
       G          A              Bm
I just called, to say how much I care.
       G          A     Bm
I just called, to say I love you.
      G                A            D
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
