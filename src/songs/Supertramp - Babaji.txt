#Intro:
Cm        Fm6    Bb                       Cm
All of my life I felt that you were listening
             Fm6     Bb               Cm
Watching for ways to help me stay in tune
               Fm6  Bb7
Oh, Lord of my dreams,
            Cm                          Gm
Although confusion keeps trying to decieve
         Ab                      Fm6   Fm7
Oh what is it that makes me believe
   G  G+
In you?

#Verse 1:
Cm                    Fm6
Babaji, oh, won’t you come to me
              Bb7
Oh, won’t you help me to face the music
Cm                      Fm6
Bring it out, so we can sing it out
           Bb7
Help us to find it before we lose it

   Ab                  Fm6
At night, when the stars are near
            Bb7                        Eb
And there’s no-one to keep you from coming here
            Ab                          Fm6
And there’s no-one to shield me before your eyes
      G7
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?

#Verse 2:
Cm                      Fm6
I can see, it’s not too good for me
       Bb7
To be afloat in the sea of glory
Cm                 Fm6
Babaji, oh how you comfort me
           Bb7
By showing me it’s a different story

   Ab                 Fm6
Your light, in the dark is real
      Bb7                         Eb
And I know that you know it is how I feel
       Ab                            Fm6
When I see the reflection that’s in your eyes
      G7
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?

#Verse 3:
Cm                    Fm6
Babaji, have you a song for me
            Bb7
To tell the world of its guardian angel
Cm                      Fm6
Bring it out, so we can sing it out
            Bb7
Oh must you always remain a stranger

   Ab                  Fm6
At night, when the stars are near
         Bb7                   Eb
And I long for delusion to disappear
            Ab                          Fm6
Then I see the reflection that’s in your eyes
      G7
Is it time, is it time, is it time to know?

#Coda:
Cm                  G7                    Cm        G7    Cm
Is it time, is it time, is it time, is it time to know
