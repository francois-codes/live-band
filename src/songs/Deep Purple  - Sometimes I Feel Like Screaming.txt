#Verse 1
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
While you were out   The message says
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
You left a number    And I tried to call   But they
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
wrote it down i      A perfect Spanish
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
scrawl....            Perfect Spanish scrawl

#Pre Chorus
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
Yet again I'm             missing you
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
King size bed    in a     hotel someplace
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
I hear your name        I see your face
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
.....                   I see your face

#Chorus
      F5                   Bb5
(The) back street dolls   And the side door johnnies
    F5                C5
The wide eyed boys   with their bags full of money
Ab5                 Db5
Back in the alley   Going bang to the wall
Ab5                 Eb5
Tied to the tail    Of a midnight crawl
F5                   Bb5
Heaven wouldn't be   So high I know
F5                     C5
If the times gone by   Hadn't been so low
Ab5                 Db5
The best laid plans Come apart at the seams
Ab5                Eb5
And shatter all my dreams...

#Verse 2
N.C
Sometimes I feel like
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
Screaming ...            Close my eyes
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4       C
It's times like this   my head goes down
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
And the only thing      I know is the name
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4     C
of this town...          Name of this towm

Yet again             I'm missing you

Won't be long           I'm' coming home
D5       Gmadd9  Gm       Csus4      C
Until that distant        time  I'll be

Moving on....          I'll be moving on
