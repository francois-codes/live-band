#Verse
  G7/D | Cm         G/B   Cm  
I miss my friends and my guitar
    G/D  | Cm     Ddim Cm/Eb
I'm knowing I can travel far
    Cm   |  Fm   D7/F#    G
But now I'm only standing here
   G |(2/4) Cm  G/B     |  Cm    
Completely paralyzed with fear

     G7/D | Cm     G/B   Cm
The fear of who I come to be
   G/D   | Cm     Ddim   Cm/Eb
Of all the weaknesses in me
   Cm  | Fm       D7/F#   G
I truly thought I was prepared
    G |(2/4) Cm      G/B     |  Cm   
But now I'm panicked and I'm scared

#Chorus
  | Fm          Bb   | Eb  G/D  Cm
But how did I become a co - o - ward?
| Fm         G7  | Cm  G/D    Cm/Eb  Cm
How did I become a co - o - ward?
| Fm        Bb   | Eb  G/D  Cm
How did I become a co - o - ward?
| Fm         G7  | Cm  G/D    Cm
How did I become a co - o - ward?

#Verse
  G7/D | Cm       G/B   Cm  
I lived alone and I was free
  G/D  | Cm    Ddim    Cm/Eb
To do whatever came to me
    Cm   | Fm  D7/F#   G
But I was craving to share,
G |(2/4) Cm     G/B  | Cm   
If only I could ever dare

  G7/D     | Cm     G/B     Cm  
To care for someone else but me
  G/D  | Cm   Ddim    Cm/Eb
If our two created three ?
   C7/E  | Fm           G
But can I let go of the thrill
G |(2/4) Cm     G/B  | Cm   
Turn it into something real

#Chorus
| Fm          Bb   | Eb    G/D  Cm
But how did I become a co - o - ward?
| Fm         G7  | Cm  G/D    Cm/Eb
How did I become a co - o - ward?
