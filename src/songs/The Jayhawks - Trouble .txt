#Verse 1
A                    C#
Trouble, that's what we had
    D
And everything that goes around
Dm                              A
Comes around in a bittersweet laments
        C#m                    G
Well my heart's already broken down
E
Looking for a sweeter sound
E
Looking for a brighter day

#Verse 2
    A                C#
I'm face down on the pavement
D                          Dm                                  A
Step aside, see the light, close your eyes and let us live our lives
        C#m                      G
As they rally around the sinking ship
E
Looking for a better way
E                             A
It was just the blind leading the blind

#Chorus
A    F#m
     oooooo   yeaaaaah
D                         Bm
I got my feet back on the ground
C#m                    Bm
It's better than being alone
C#m                    Bm          E
It's better than being alone

#Verse 3
A                  C#
Funny, we tried it all
                     D
Just standing on the brink
        Dm          A
Looking down, down, down
A         C#m                          G
There's a little bit of truth in every lie
E
You were so above us all
E                             A
It was just the blind leading the blind

#Chorus
A    F#m
     oooooo   yeaaaaah
D                         Bm
I got my feet back on the ground
C#m                    Bm
It's better than being alone
C#m                    Bm
It's better than being alone

#Bridge
Bm                      D                   A
We were stranded on the vine, destitute and shaken
              F#m
Looking for a sign
Bm               D                          A
Left hung out to dry, our backs against the wall
                |  F#m    |  F#m    |  D    |  D    |  E     |
Stoned out of our minds

#Chorus
A    F#m
     oooooo   yeaaaaah
D                         Bm
I got my feet back on the ground
C#m                     Bm
It's better than being alone
C#m                    Bm
It's better than being alone
C#m          Bm
Oooooooooooo woooooo
C#m          Bm        E (NC)
