#Chorus
G7 F    C                 G7
Foolish heart you made me weep
                           C
Foolish heart I'm yours to keep
               C7                F
You're the one that's still with me
        G7                 C    F C
Foolish heart don't set me free

#verse 1
G7                                C
There was a time when you said to me
              G7          C
Don't fall in love so easily
    C7              F   G7        C
But then she walked in  and right away
    D7                         G7
You never had another thing to say

#chorus
        C                 G7
Foolish heart you made me weep
                           C
Foolish heart I'm yours to keep
               C7                F
You're the one that's still with me
        G7                 C    F C
Foolish heart don't set me free

#Verse 2
         G7                 C
She went away and now we're alone
               G7                  C
I asked her to stay but she had to go
      C7          F     G7              C
She's made up her mind  that I'm just a fool
   D7                                    G7
My love is blind and it's all because of you

#chorus
        C                 G7
Foolish heart you made me weep
                           C
Foolish heart I'm yours to keep
               C7                F
You're the one that's still with me

        G7                 C    F C
Foolish heart don't set me free
        G7                 C   F C
Foolish heart don't set me free
