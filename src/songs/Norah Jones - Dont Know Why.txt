 Bbmaj7    Bb7            Ebmaj7    D5+
I waited 'til I saw the sun
Gm7          C7       F7sus4  Bb
I don't know why I didn't come
Bbmaj7      Bb7       Ebmaj7   D5+
I left you by the house of fun
Gm7          C7     F7sus4    Bb
I don't know why I didn't come
  Gm7        C7             F7sus4
I don't know why I didn't come

Bbmaj7  Bb7     Ebmaj7    D5+
When I saw the break of day
Gm7           C7      F7sus4   Bb
I wished that I could fly away
    Bbmaj7    Bb7   Ebmaj7   D5+
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Gm7      C7        F7sus4  Bb
Catching teardrops in my hand


#Chorus
       Gm7  C7          | F    |  F7   |
My heart is drenched in wine
       Gm7    C7          F7
But you'll be on my mind
F7/Eb   Bb/D     F/C
For  ...   ev   ...   er


#Verse
Bbmaj7      Bb7        Ebmaj7      D5+
Out       across the endless sea
Gm7     C7       F7sus4     Bb
I would die in ecstasy
Bbmaj7   Bb7     Ebmaj7        D5+
But I'll     be a bag of bones
Gm7        C7         F7sus4 Bb
Driving down the road alone


#Chorus
Gm7         C7           F     F7
My heart is drenched in wine
    Gm7      C7      F7
But you'll be on my mind
 Bbmaj7  Bb7  Ebmaj7  D7+5  Gm7  C7  F7sus4
For   ev  er

#Verse
Bbmaj7       Bb7         Ebmaj7     D5+
Something has to make you run
Gm7          C7       F7sus4   Bb
I don't know why I didn't come

Bbmaj7     Bb7     Ebmaj7    D5+
I feel as empty as a drum
Gm7          C7      F7        Bb
I don't know why I didn't come
  Gm7        C7              F7  Bb
I don't know why I didn't come
   Gm7       C7      F7sus4  Bb
I don't know why I didn't come
