#Verse 1
D          A                Bm            G                 D
  So lately you're wondering who will be there to take my place
             A                Bm            G                D
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
      A                Bm       G            D
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
        A                   Bm             G
Then between the sand and stone could you make it on your own?


#Chorus
D           A            Bm            G              D
  If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           A           Bm            G              D
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go


#Verse 2
(D)      A             Bm        G                 D
And maybe I'll find out a way to make it back someday
           A            Bm           G                D
To want you to guide you through the darkest of your days
      A                Bm       G            D
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
        A                    Bm               G
Then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you


#Chorus
D           A            Bm            G              D
  If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           A           Bm            G             Bm
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go


#Bridge
(Bm)   G                A
       Run away with my heart
F#m               Bm
Run away with my hope
G                 A        F#m
Run away with my love


#Verse 3 (Play intro until second F)
D           A
  I know now just quite how
Bm            G                    D
  My life and love might still go on
             A
In your heart, in your mind
Bm                G              D
  I'll stay with you for all of time


#Chorus
(D)       A            Bm            G              D
If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           A           Bm            G              D
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

           A          Bm               G              D
If I could turn back time, I'll go wherever you will go
           A         Bm               G              D
If I could make you mine, I'll go wherever you will goooooooo

A      Bm              G              D       A      Bm    G
ooooo      I'll go wherever you will goooooooooooooo
