#verse 1
   G                       Am          G
	It's taken you so long, where can you be
   Bm                           Am
	I wouldn't lay my life down for you
   C                   D   C               D                     Am
	Nothing seems real, nothing seems real, now that you're gone


   G                       Am                  G
	Have you seen the sisters, blue-eyed, curls of gold
   Bm                                Am
	Hell and no one there to be seen
   C                        D   C                       D                 Am       A
	The sunlight looks down, stripped bare to the ground, cut by the leaves

#chorus
   D                         Bm                    D          Bm
	Been crowded in the wings, mostly I don't mind
   D                         Bm                    Gmaj7      A
	Been crowded in the wings, then it's you I find
                       Gmaj7 A                 D
	Then it's you I find, then it's you I find

Bm   | D   | Bm   | Am   |

#verse 2
   G                 Am            G
	Two hundred yards in front of the man
   Bm                                  Am
	He could never see his way to another day
   C                        D   C      D                Am
	This time I met the same cold cold cold cold once again

#chorus
   D                         Bm                    D          Bm
	Been crowded in the wings, mostly I don't mind
   D                         Bm                    Gmaj7      A
	Been crowded in the wings, then it's you I find
                       Gmaj7 A                 D
	Then it's you I find, then it's you I find

#bridge
                       Bm                D
	You brought me to the mother of mountains
                       Bm
	You brought me to
   F#                       Bm
	And no one needs to you at night
   F#                              Bm
	And all your lies came to pass
   F#                                    A
	Just something I said, made you turn your life then

#chorus
   D                         Bm                    D          Bm
	Been crowded in the wings, mostly I don't mind
   D                         Bm                    Gmaj7      A
	Been crowded in the wings, then it's you I find
                       Gmaj7 A                 D
	Then it's you I find, then it's you I find
