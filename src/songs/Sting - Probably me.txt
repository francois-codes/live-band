Emmaj9  Em6/9   Em9       Em6/9


#Verse 1
               Emmaj9                    Em6/9
If the night turned cold - and the stars looked down
           Em9                    Em6/9
And you hug yourself - on the cold cold ground
        Am7                             Bm7
You wake the morning - in a stranger's coat
                  Em      G6       Em
No one would you see


#Chorus
            Am7                     Bm7
You ask yourself - who'd watch for me
        Em                    Em/C#
My only friend - who could it be
                 C - C/9        B7     
It's hard to say it - I hate to say it
              Emmaj9 - Em6/9
it's probably me


#Verse 2
               Emmaj9                    Em6/9
When you belly's empty - and the hunger's so real
           Em9                           Em6/9
You're too proud to beg - and too dumb to steal
        Am7                         Bm7
You search the city - for your only friend
                Em      G6      Em
No one would you see


#Chorus
        Am7                       Bm7
You ask yourself, - who could it be
        Em                                   Em/C#
A solitary voice to speak out and set you free
        C        C/9       B7               
I hate to say it - I hate to say it,
              Emmaj9 - Em6/9
it's probably me


#Bridge
                  Am7                         D - Dsus4 - D
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
         G (bass-walk-down G,F#,E)   Em7     
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
              Am7                          D - Dsus4 - D
Some would say I should let you go your way
                  G
You'll only make me cry


#Chorus
Am7                       Bm7
If there's one guy - just one guy
     Em                      Em/C#
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
        C        C/9       B7                
It's hard to say it - It's hard to say it
              Emmaj9 - Em6/9
but it's probably me


#Verse 3
       Emmaj9                            Em6/9
When the world's gone crazy - and it makes no sense
             Em9                           Em6/9
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
                 Am7                 Bm7
When the jury's out and your eyes search the room
                                   Em             G6   Em
And one friendly face is all you need to see


#Chorus
              Am7             Bm7
If there's one guy - just one guy
     Em                        Em/C#
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
              C   C/9       B7         
It's hard to say it  - I hate to say it,
               Am7    A7
but it's probably me
     C        C/9             B7                
I hate to say it - I hate to say it,  
           Emmaj9 - Em6/9 (2x)
it's probably me
