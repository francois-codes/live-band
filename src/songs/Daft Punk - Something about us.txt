#Verse 1
BbMaj7           Am7
It might not be the right time
Dm6                  G
I might not be the right one
            BbMaj7               A7
But there's something about us I want to say
              D7sus4                   G7
Cause there's something between us anyway


#Verse 2
BbMaj7              Am7
I might not be the right one
Dm6                   G
It might not be the right time
            BbMaj7                  A7
But there's something about us I've got to do
D7sus4                     G7
Some kind of secret I will share with you


#Verse 3
BbMaj7                   Am7
I need you more than anything in my life
Dm6                       G
I want you more than anything in my life
BbMaj7                      A7
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
D7sus4                    G7
I love you more than anyone in my life
