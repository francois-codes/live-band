#Intro
| A      | A/G#   | F#m    | D      |


#Verse
  A                A/G#
I heard that you're settled down
        F#m
That you found a girl
          D
And you're married now
  A               A/G#
I heard that your dreams came true
          F#m
Guess she gave you things
          D
I didn't give to you

 A                       A/G#
Old friend why are you so shy
              F#m
It ain't like you to hold back
   D
Or hide from life


#Bridge
  E9                         F#m                  D
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
D
couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
    E9
I'd hoped you'd see my face
    F#m                             D           E9/D  D
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over


#Chorus
A                E                 F#m   D
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       A               E        F#m  D
I wish nothing but the best for you  too
         A           E      F#m        D
Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said
             A                 E                     F#m   D
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
             A                 E                     F#m   D
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah


#Verse
A                  A/G#
 You'd know how the time flies
    F#m
Only yesterday
        D
was the time of our lives
        A
We were born and raised
    A/G#
In a summer haze
      F#m                    D
Bound by the surprise of our glory days


#Bridge
  E9                         F#m                  D
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
D
couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
    E9
I'd hoped you'd see my face
    F#m                             D           E9/D  D
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over


#Chorus
A                E                 F#m D
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       A               E        F#m D
I wish nothing but the best for you too
         A        E        F#m       D
Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said
             A                 E                     F#m   D
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead, yeah


#Break
E/B
Nothing compares no worries or cares
F#m/C#
Regrets and mistakes their memories make
D
Who would have known how
       Bm    A/C#       D    E/D
Bitter-sweet this would taste


#Chorus
A               E/G#              F#m D
Never mind I’ll find someone like you
       A               E/G#     F#m D
I wish nothing but the best for yo--ou
         A        E        F#m       D
Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said
             A                 E/G#                  F#m    D
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead


#Chorus
A              E                  F#m D
Never mind I’ll find someone like you
       A               E        F#m D
I wish nothing but the best for you too
      A           E        F#m       D
Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said
             A                 E                     F#m    D
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
             A                 E                     F#m    D           A
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead   Yeah Yeah
