#intro
Bm A G F#

#Verse
Bm                 A
Baby, do you understand me now?
G                   F#
Sometimes I feel a little mad
     Bm                                    A
But, don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
G                       F#
When things go wrong I seem to be bad

#chorus
        D                       Bm
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
G                            F#          Bm
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Bm   A   G   F#


#bridge
G          A
If I seem edgy
G              A
I want you to know
G              A              F#      D
That I never meant to take it out on you
G             A
Life has its problems
G             A
And I got my share
G                A             F#     D
And that's one thing I never meant to do
G              F#
'Cause I love you

#verse
Bm                  A
Baby, don't you know I'm just human
G                          F#
And I've got thoughts like any other one
     Bm                         A
And sometimes I find myself, oh Lord, regretting
G                         F#
Some foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done

#chorus
     D                      Bm
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
G                            F#          Bm
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
