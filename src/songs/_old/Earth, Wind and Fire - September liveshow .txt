Do you remember
   C#m7      F#m7       Dmaj7_C#m7_Bm7
the 21st night of September?
         C#m7           F#m7         Dmaj7_C#m7_Bm7
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
     C#m7         F#m7     A7sus
While chasing the clouds away

                Dmaj7_C#m7_Bm7
Our hearts were ringing
       C#m7           F#m7         Dmaj7_C#m7_Bm7
In the key that our souls were singing
       C#m7            F#m7     Dmaj7_C#m7_Bm7
As we danced in the night, remember
C#m7     C#7          F#m7       A7sus
How the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
