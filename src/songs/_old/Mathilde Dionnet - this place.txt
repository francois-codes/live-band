I know there is a place, I feel it’s here somewhere
  Em               A           Em          A
I belong to this place, But I don’t know where
    Em                A            Em                A
I’m looking for this place, Where kindness’s in the air
    Em                   A         Em           A
I’m sure there is this place, Even hidden somewhere

#Pré-Refrain :
    F#m           Bm
But I’m not from here
    F#m           Bm
And I’m not from there
3/4  | C		      |  A            |
I’m a stranger everywhere

#Refrain :
3/4 | F#m             |  D              |
     Not from the north, Not from the south
4/4       |   A           E        |
     Feeling lost, in my path
3/4 | F#m             |  D              |
    Could be the west, Even the east
4/4    |   A          E          |
    From where do I exist

#Couplet :
    Em               A           Em                 A
I’m heading to this place, Where shadows can give grace
     Em                 A         Em        A
I’m longing for this place, A new home, I guess
   Em                 A               Em               A
I know I’ll find my place, When it’s time, it’s not a race
    Em             A               Em      A
And in that very place, Love would set my pace

I’m a stranger everywhere

     Feeling lost, in my path

    Could be the west, Even the east
