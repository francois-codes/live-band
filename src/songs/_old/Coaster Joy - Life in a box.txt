G                                       |  Cmaj7   	C  |
   I’ve heard your joys,  I’ve shared your pain
G   			              		            |  Cmaj7   	C  |
   I’ve heard you singing, I’ve heard you crying
          Am                                     Dsus4
I don’t  know your name nor your face, but I know you
       Am                                         | C       D |
I can  tell your voice  for sure, your words are soothing

G                                        |  Cmaj7   	C  |
    I’ve heard you shouting, I’ve heard you laughin'
G                              |  Cmaj7   	C  |
    Every step,  I followed your pace
  	 Am                      		           Dsus4
Every night we spent together,  I felt so  warm
       Am                                  | C  D  C/E  C  |
I can  sense your mood  at once, I feel it from within

‘Cause you can’t   keep life in a box for long
  Am                           |  D   Dsus4   D   Dsus4   |
life  won’t fit in a box  too long

#Verse
G                                 |  Cmaj7   	C  |
Deep in your flesh, from under your skin
G   			               	   |  Cmaj7   	C  |
Rumble of days,  and echoes of joy  
        Am                                    Dsus4
I have closed my eyes so long, I’m sleepling awake
       Am                                         | C  D  C/E  C  |
I may  miss on some of your words, but I like the chime of life

#Chorus
 D            Adim          Cmaj7          | C    |
See___ I know we___’ll be  meeting soon enough
 D            Adim        Cmaj7           | C     |
Soo__n   you will be____  holding my hand in yours
  	       Am               	  		  D
‘Cause you can’t   keep life in a box for long
  Am                           |  D      |
life  won’t fit in a box  too long

#Bridge
Bm    				                Em      
    Though I’ve been alone, stranded in the dark
Bm                   Em      
    Floating upside down  on my own
      	 F#7   			          	     G
I’m not scared  to see the light of day
        F#7 					            	  Bm
And I feel  the world’s all mine  to sway
     	  C   			              |  D           |	 Dsus4   |
I can’t wait  to see the colors  you will spray
