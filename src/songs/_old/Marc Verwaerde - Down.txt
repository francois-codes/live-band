#Chorus 1
G	    B7                        | Em    Em/D#  | Em7   Em/C# |
Snow, slopes, bringing down the pain
Cmaj7  B7                        | Em    Em/D#  | Em7   Em/C# |
Slow ropes on my memory lane
    C 	Cm	                  	|	G      Gsus4      | %           |  
Of hope     of a future life in chains

#Verse 1
G    	C	          | G     Gsus4   |
 Snow falls on my face
G             C	       | G     Gsus4   |
 Everytime I think of you
G      	C	    | G     Gsus4   |
 If I close my eyes
G        	C	          | G     Gsus4   |
 I get comfort in my chest

#Verse 2
G       	C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 Singing songs I know by heart
G      	C	        | G     Gsus4   |
 Won't lead me anywhere
G        C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 Like an old and beat up truck
G          C	       | G     G       |
 It won't lead me anywhere

#Chorus 2
G	    B7                        | Em    Em/D#  | Em7   Em/C# |
Snow, slopes, bringing down the pain
Cmaj7  B7                        | Em    Em/D#  | Em7   Em/C# |
Slow ropes on my memory lane
    C 	Cm	                  	| G     Gsus4   | %            |  
Of hope     of a future life in chains

#Verse 3
G       	C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 Riding at high speed
G       	C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 It eases my mind
G       	C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 Can't think of anything
G       	C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 It eases my mind

#Verse 4
G       	C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 A white coat of snow
G       	C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 Calms everything down
G       	C	            | G     Gsus4   |
 Nature is asleep
G       	C	            | G     G       |
 And everyone is fine

#Chorus 3
G	    B7                        | Em    Em/D#  | Em7   Em/C# |
Snow, slopes, bringing down the pain (break)
Cmaj7   B7                        | Em    Em/D#  | Em7   Em/C# |
Slow ropes on my memory lane
    C 	Cm	                  	|	G    
Of hope of a future life in chains
       G/F#    | Em   Em/D#  | Cmaj7        | Cm        |


#Outro
    G          G/F#    Em
The birds have flown away
        Em/D#           | Cmaj7     | Cm     |
They're searching for the sun
    G          G/F# 	Em
And I'm left alone to pray
        Em/D#          | Cmaj7     | Cm     |
For the snow to calm me down
| G     G/F#    | Em   Em/D#  | Cmaj7        | Cm        |  (8x)
Down, Down, Down, Down, Down, Down...
