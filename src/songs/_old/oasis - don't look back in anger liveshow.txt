#Intro
|C    |F    |C    |F    |


#Verse 1
C               G            Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E              F    G
Don't you know you might find
                  C      Am G
A better place to play

C             G           Am
You said that you'd never been
            E                  F    G
But all the things that you've seen
             C    Am G F
Slowly fade away


#Pre-Chorus
F                Fm             C
So I start a revolution from my bed
         F                 Fm             C
'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
F                 Fm              C
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom

G
Stand up beside the fireplace
    G#dim
And take that look from off your face
Am             G             F       | G     | G     |
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out


#Chorus
C  G         Am        E              F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C   Am G
as we're walking on by
    C    G       Am   E
Her soul slides away,
               F             G
but don't look back in anger
          |  C    G  |  Am    E  |  F    G   | C    Am G |
I heard you say
