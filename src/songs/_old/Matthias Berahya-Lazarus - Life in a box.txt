  	 Am                      		      D(sus4)
Every night we spent together,  I felt so_  wa_rm

Deep in your flesh, from under your skin
G   			              		    Cmaj7         (C)
Rumble of days,  and echoes of joy  
          Am                                    D(sus4)
I have closed my eyes so long, I’m sleepling awake
       Am                                         C
I may_  miss on some of your words, but I like the chime of life

#Bridge
Bm    				         Em      
    Though I’ve been alone, stranded in the dark
Bm                     Em      
    Floating upside do___wn  on my own
   	 F#7   				     G
I’m not scared  to see the light of day
        F#7 						  Bm
And I fee_l  the world’s all mine  to sway__
  	  C   			   	            D   	     Dsus4      D7
I can’t wait  to see the colors  you will spray
