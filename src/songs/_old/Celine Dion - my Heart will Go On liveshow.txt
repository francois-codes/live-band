#Verse
E              B
Every night in my dreams
  A         E    B
I see you I feel you
E             B           A
that is how I know you go on.
E              B
Far across the distance
    A      E       B
and spaces between us
E                B           A
you have come to show you go on.


#Chorus
C#m   B          A        B
Near, far, where ever you are
  C#m              B             A
I believe that the heart does go on.
C#m  B         A        B
Once more, you open the door
           C#m        B
and you're here in my heart and
   A             B      E
my heart will go on and on.
