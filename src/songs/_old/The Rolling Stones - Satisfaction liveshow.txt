#Chorus
E                A
 I can't get no ... satisfaction
E                A
 I can't get no ... satisfaction
         E         B         E         A
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
        E         A
I can't get no #riff
        E       D/A
I can't get no #riff


#Verse
     A   E             D/A
When I'm drivin' in my car
    A E                D/A
And a man comes on the radio
    A    E                   D/A
And he's tellin' me more and more
      A    E            A
About some useless information
         A  E             A
Supposed to drive my imagination

        E         D/A
I can't get no
    A   E
No, no, no (break)
        E      D/A
Hey hey hey
            A | E | D/A    A |
That's what I say
 | E       | D/A    A | E        | D/A    A |
