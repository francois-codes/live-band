#Verse 1
    F                   C           C7                   F
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better
  Bb                           F                    C       C7      F
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better

    F               C               C7                 F
Hey Jude, don’t be afraid, you were made to go out and get her
    Bb                             F                C      C7      F
The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better

#Chorus
F7                       Bb         Dm      Gm                     C7              F
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, don’t carry the world upon your shoulders
F7                            Bb        Dm       Gm                                                C7                 F
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool by making his world a little colder
F        F7    C7                    NC  (4 temps + 2 temps)
