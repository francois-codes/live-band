english pop 70s


#Verse 1
A                   F                E                C#
Out on the windey, windy moors we'd roll and fall in green,
A                 F                 E             C#
You had a temper, like my jealousy, too hot, too greedy
A                       F                E
How could you leave me, when I needed to possess you?
C#           Ab
I hated you, I loved you too


#Pre Chorus
Ebm7 Gb           Fsus4
Bad dreams in the night
Ebm7         Gb    Fsus4
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Ebm7     Gb      Fsus4
Leave behind my Wuthering Wuthering Wuthering Heights


#Chorus
Fsus4 Gb    Ebm7     Ab7                    Db     Gb
Heathcliff, It's me, Cathy, I've come home, I'm so cold
Gb     Ab7       Db   Gb
Let me in-a-your window
Gb          Ebm7     Ab7                    Db     Gb
Heathcliff, It's me, Cathy, I've come home, I'm so cold
Gb     Ab7       Db   Gb
Let me in-a-your window


#Verse 2
A                 F               E            C#
Oh, it gets dark, it gets lonely, on the other side from you
A             F            E             C#
I pine a lot, I find a lot falls through without you
A                     F                 E             C#      Ab
I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff, my one dream, my only master


#Pre Chorus #2
Ebm7     Gb        Fsus4
Too long I roam in the night
Ebm7       Gb      Fsus4
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
Ebm7   Gb          Fsus4
I'm coming home to Wuthering Wuthering Wuthering Heights


#Chorus
Fsus4 Gb    Ebm7          Ab7                    Db     Gb
Heathcliff, It's me, your Cathy, I've come home, I'm so cold
Gb     Ab7       Db   Gb
Let me in-a-your window
Gb          Ebm7          Ab7                    Db     Gb
Heathcliff, It's me, your Cathy, I've come home, I'm so cold
Gb     Ab7       Db   Gb
Let me in-a-your window


#Bridge
Bbm   Ab                    Gb        Ebm     Db
Ooh, let me have it, let me grab your soul away
Bbm           Ab  Gb   ... Bbm
You know it's me, Cathy


#Chorus
Fsus4 Gb    Ebm7     Ab7                    Db     Gb
Heathcliff, It's me, Cathy, I've come home, I'm so cold
Gb     Ab7       Db   Gb
Let me in-a-your window
Gb          Ebm7     Ab7                    Db     Gb
Heathcliff, It's me, Cathy, I've come home, I'm so cold
Gb     Ab7       Db   Gb
Let me in-a-your window
