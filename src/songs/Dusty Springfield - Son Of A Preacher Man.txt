Billy Ray was a preacher's son
              A                     E
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along

When they'd gather 'round and started talking

 Cousin Billy would take me walking

through the back yard we'd go walking

Then he'd look into my eyes

Lord knows to my surprise

The only one who could ever reach me

Being good isn't always easy
       A              E
No matter how hard I tried

He'd come and tell me everything is all right

He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right

 The look that was in his eyes

Stealin' kisses from me on the sly

 Lookin to see how much we'd grown and
