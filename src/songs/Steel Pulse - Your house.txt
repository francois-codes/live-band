 Your love is a, life for I,

 Realised that so much when I, first met you.

 That was some time ago, oh, from then, until this,

#Bridge 1:
Dm                   Em     Am
 Was in a little situ-ation;  came with a solution,

Tri-umphant calling, tri-umphant trumpets.

 'Cos at the close of the day they'll be so far away.
Am                              G
 But then I know one thing's for certain;
Dm                            F
 'Cos at the closing of the... woo, oh, oh, oh.
Am                        G
 Yes, I know one thing for certain;

You'll be there, you'll be there.

 Once when I was, once when I was,
