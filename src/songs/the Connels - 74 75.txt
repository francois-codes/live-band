#Verse
F         C          F                    C    (G)      F
   Got no reason for coming to me and the rain running down.
           C         Am
There's no reason.
F          C          F                      C    (G)     F
   And the same voice coming to me like it's all slowing down.
       C          G
And believe me

          Am              C                G          F        Am  C  G
I was the one who let you know, I was your sorry-ever-after. '74-'75

F           C     F                          C  (G)    F
   It's not easy, nothing to say 'cause it's already said.
           C      Am
It's never easy.

       F            C           Am        G       F
When I look on your eyes then I find that I'll do fine.
       Am           C              G
When I look on your eyes then I do better.


#Chorus
          Am              C                G          F        Am  C  G
I was the one who let you know, I was your sorry-ever-after. '74-'75
         Am              C                G           F       Am  C  G
Givin me more and i'll defy, cause you're really only after '74-'75.
