#Intro
| C#m  B  | C#m     | C#m  B  | C#m     |

| C#m  B  | C#m     | C#m  B  | C#m     |
   Como puede ser verdad

#Verse
C#m             B            C#m
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
A    C#m        E            B
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
C#m                 B              C#m
A young girl with eyes like the desert
A  C#m               E             B
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

#Chorus
C#m            B
Tropical the island breeze
F#m             E
All of nature wild and free
B                F#m
This is where I long to be
F#m        C#m
La isla bonita

C#m              B
  And when the samba played
F#m               E
  The sun would set so high
     B                   F#m
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     G#m           C#m
Your Spanish lullaby
| C#m  B  | C#m     | C#m  B  | C#m     |

#Verse
C#m        B            C#m
I fell in love with San Pedro
A       C#m         E                B
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
C#m         B      C#m
        Te dijo te amo
A     C#m            E                     B
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

#Chorus
C#m            B
Tropical the island breeze
F#m             E
All of nature wild and free
B                F#m
This is where I long to be
F#m        C#m
La isla bonita

C#m              B
  And when the samba played
F#m               E
  The sun would set so high
     B                   F#m
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     G#m           C#m
Your Spanish lullaby
| C#m  B  | C#m     | C#m  B  | C#m     |


#Bridge
F#m        D            E            F#m
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
           F#m         D            E          E
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
F#m          D        E            F#m
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
         F#m           D         E    E   G#      (C#m)
Where a girl loves a boy, and a booooy    loves a girl
