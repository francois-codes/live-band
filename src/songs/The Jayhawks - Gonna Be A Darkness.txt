#Intro
|(2/4)  Bm  G | (4/4)  D        | G          | (x8)


#Verse 1
Bm      G             D
There's gonna be roses
                          G
And your picture in a frame
D                 A/C#
The women will be crying
        G/B            A            D
And the men, they will whisper your name

Bm       G        D
Umbrellas will be open
                        G
On a hill side of graves
D                     A/C#
The children will be dressed up
        G/B      A          D
And chase each other in the rain

#Chorus
            D
And there's gonna be a darkness
      A/C#
Maybe colder than you guess
      G
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
      A
There may not be angels filling the air

     D
Your mother may be there
     A/C#
Your father may be there
      G
There may not be voices
                      A
Sent from a throne to carry you home

#Instrumental
|(2/4)  Bm  G | (4/4)  D        | G          | (x8)


#Verse 2
Bm     G          D
Oh heaven may not get you
                      G
The devil may see you first
D                 A/C#      G/B
He's hidden himself in both
       A          D
The beast and the bird
Bm       G          D
A stranger may have found you
                                    G
Where the angels have lulled you to sleep
D                A            G
They swallow you whole like a whale
          A            D
From your head to your feet

#Chorus
            D
And there's gonna be a darkness
      A/C#
Maybe colder than you guess
      G
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
      A
There may not be angels filling the air

     D
Your mother may be there
     A/C#
Your father may be there
      G
There may not be voices
                      A
Sent from a throne to carry you home

#Solo

|  D        | G          |


#Bridge
A                        Em
Well you think there's a place
              A
Wide open and wide
                          Em
Where you think you'll be safe
                          A
Where you think there's a light

#Chorus very light
            D
And there's gonna be a darkness
      A/C#
Maybe colder than you guess
      G
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
      A
There may not be angels filling the air

#chorus tutti
     D
Your mother may be there
     A/C#
Your father may be there
      G
There may not be voices
                      A
Sent from a throne to carry you home

#Outro
Bm      G             D
There's gonna be roses
                           G
And your picture in a frame
D                 A/C#
The women will be crying
        G/B            A            D
And the men, they will whisper your name
