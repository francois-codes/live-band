#Verse1
   C                                Fm/C
I used to think that i could not go on
     C                         Fm/C
And life was nothing but an awful song
    C                            Fm/C
But now I know the meaning of true love
C                           Fm/C
I'm kneeling on the everlasting lines

#Pre-chorus
Eaug     C/A
If I can see it
          Fm/Ab
Then I can do it
            C/G
If I just believe it
              Csus4/G
There's nothing to it

#Chorus
                 C                    Am7
I believe i can fly, I believe i can touch the sky
                        Dm7
I think about it every night and day
                    F/G
Spread my wings and fly away
    E/Ab        Am
I believe I can soar
                             Fm/Ab
I see me running through that open door
                C/G                  Fm/Ab
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
              Amadd9    C/G
I believe I can fly      

#Verse2
  C                               Fm/C
See I   was on the verge of breaking out
 C                            Fm/C
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
C                            Fm/C
There are miracles in life i must achieve
     C                              Fm/C
But first I know it starts inside of me oh oh

#Pre-chorus
Eaug     C/A
If I can see it
          Fm/Ab
Then I can do it
            C/G
If I just believe it
              Csus4/G
There's nothing to it

#Chorus
                 C                    Am7
I believe i can fly, I believe i can touch the sky
                        Dm7
I think about it every night and day
                    F/G
Spread my wings and fly away
    E/Ab        Am
I believe I can soar
                             Fm/Ab
I see me running through that open door
                C/G                  Fm/Ab
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
              Amadd9    C/G
I believe I can fly
