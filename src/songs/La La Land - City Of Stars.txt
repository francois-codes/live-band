#Verse 1 [Sebastian]
Gm             C                            Dm
City of stars      Are you shining just for me?
Gm             C                               F
City of stars     There's so much that I can't see
    Gm     C                              F       Am/E      Adim/Eb
Who knows?    I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
           Gm        A9                          Dm   Dm/C
[Mia] That now our dreams, they've finally come true

#Verse 2 [Mia]

There in the bars     And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
      Gm7  C7                                F         Am/E   Adim/Eb
It's love     Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
  Gm                     A9
[Seb] A rush, [Mia] A glance, [Seb] A touch, [Mia] A dance

#Bridge 1 [both]
   Bb                 C7                   A7
A look in somebody's eyes to light up the skies
              Dm
To open the world and send it reeling
   Bb                       C7                   | Dm_Dm/E_Dm/F_Dm/E       |   %  |  
A voice that says, I'll be here And you'll be alright

#Bridge 2 [both]
Bb                 C7                     A7/C#_A7
I don't care if I know, just where I will go
                   Dm
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
   Bb                 A
A rat-tat-tat on my heart
                         Dm_Dm/C
[seb] Think I want it to stay

#Outro [seb]
Gm            C                            F
City of stars    Are you shining just for me?
Gm            A9                               Dm
City of stars    You never shined so brightly
