#Verse
                 F
If you want my love
                      Dm
He gotta do what he does
                    Gm               C
If you want these sweet like sugar Gucci lips
C
He gotta give it
                      F
I know you think I'm cool
                         Dm
But I ain't one of the boys
      Gm                                      C
No, don't be scared that I'm gon' tie you down
%
I need a little more


#Chorus
        F                   Dm
Baby, don't call me your friend
       Gm               C
If I hear that word again
           Am           Dm              Gm            C
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
             F                  Dm
And I know girls ain't hard to find
            Gm              C
But if you think you wanna try
       Am                Dm          Gm           C
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye

               F           Dm
Give me that title, title
                       Gm           C
Come on give me that title, title
                     F            Dm
Better give me that title, title
                       Gm          C
Come on give me that title, title


#Verse
                F
If it ain't no game
                      Dm
I won't be hanging around
            Gm                          C
But don't blow up my shit at 3 AM saying; "How you need me now?"
               F
Don't call me boo
                      Dm
Like I'm so kind of ghost
              Gm
If you don't want me seeking other guys
C
 Well, here's what you need to know


#Chorus
        F                   Dm
Baby, don't call me your friend

If I hear that word again
           Am           Dm              Gm            C
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed

#Bridge
F            Dm
Say I'm a special kind of woman
      Gm                          C
I'm loving what you got, but I'm hating what you doing
 A                          Dm                      Gm                     C
Gotta understand that I'm looking for a man who can get up on a bike, look mom, no hands
F         Dm
You gotta show me off, off
Gm                       C
But you embarrassed, if that's the case I'm all gone
A                          Dm                      Gm
You gotta treat me like a trophy, put me on the shelf
                      C
I promise something else


#Chorus
        F                   Dm
Baby, don't call me your friend
       Gm               C
If I hear that word again
           Am           Dm              Gm            C
