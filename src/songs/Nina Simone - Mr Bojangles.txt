I knew a man Bojangles and he danced for you,    in worn out shoes.
   C       C/B              Am7     C/G          F               G
With silver hair a ragged shirt and baggy pants,    the old soft shoe

He jumped so high,     jumped so high,                  Then he lightly touched down.

   C           C/B      Am7         C/G  F        G
I met him in a cell in New Orleans I was down and out.

He looked at me to be the eyes of age        as he spoke right out.

He said his name, Bojangles, then he danced a lick, across the cell.

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the south.
C              C/B              Am7                C/G  F         G
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and he traveled about.
Am7              Em7  E7                Am7 Am7/G
His dog up and died,   up and died,

After twenty years he still grieved

But most of the time I spent behind these county bars," He said, "I drinks a bit."
Am7             Em7  E7               Am7 Am7/G
