I’m in serious shit,  I feel totally lost

If I’m asking for help it’s only because
Ab
Being with you has opened my eyes
        Cm
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?

       Fm
I keep asking myself, wondering how
Eb
I keep closing my eyes but I can’t block you out

Want to fly to a place where it’s just you and me

  |    Db                    Cm
And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
  |  Fm                      Eb
They say it's my fault but I want her so much
  |  Db                     Cm
Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain
  |     Fm                  Eb
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame

     |    Db                     Cm
When they stop and stare - don't worry me
     |    Fm                         Eb
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
    |  Db                    Cm
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
    |    Fm                 
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

Mother looking at me, tell me what do you see?

Yes, I've lost my mind
