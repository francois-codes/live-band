#Verse 1
Ab                        Abº
  It was an early morning yesterday.
Db/Ab                     Ab
  I was up before the dawn.
Ab                        Abº
  And I really have     enjoyed my stay.
Db/Ab                     Ab
 But I must be moving on.


#Bridge 1
       Ab7/Gb
Like a king without a castle.
       Fm7
Like a queen without a throne.
       Db
I'm an early morning lover.
       Bbm7
And I  must be moving on.


#Verse 2
Ab                        Ab

Ab                        Abº
  Now I believe in       what you say,
Db/Ab                     Ab
  Is the undisputed truth.
Ab                        Abº
But I have to have things my own way,
Db/Ab                     Ab
  To keep me in my youth.


#Bridge 2
       Ab7/Gb
Like a ship without an anchor.
       Fm7
Like a slave without a chain.
       Db
Just the thought of those sweet ladies,
       Bbm7
Sends a shiver through my veins.

       Ab
   And I will go on shining.
       Ab7/Gb
       Shining like brand new.
       Db
  I'll never look behind me.
       Bbm7
    My troubles will be few.


#Chorus 1
|Ab      |Ab+     |Fm/Ab   |Bbm  Eb7|

|Ab      |Ab7/Gb  |Db      |Bbm  Eb7|

Ab                     Ab7/Gb
  Goodbye stranger      it's been nice.
Db                     Bbm  Eb7
  Hope you find your    paradise.
Ab                     Ab7/Gb
  Tried to see your     point of view.
Db                     Bbm       Eb7
  Hope your dreams will all come true.

Ab                     Ab7/Gb
  Goodbye Mary,         goodbye Jane.
Db                     Bbm    Eb7
  Will we ever          meet again?
Ab                     Ab7/Gb
  Feel no sorrow,       feel no shame.
Db                     Bbm      Eb7
  Come tomorrow,        feel no pain.

#duo
             Ab                  Ab7/Gb
 Now sweet devotion   is not for me. (Goodbye Mary,       Goodbye Jane.)
             Db                  Bbm    Eb7
Just give me motion    to set me free. (Will we ever        meet again?)
                    Ab                   Ab7/Gb
In the land and the ocean           far away, (Feel no sorrow,      feel no shame.)
                    Db                   Bbm      Eb7
 It's the life I've chosen,        every day. (Come tomorrow,       feel no pain.)
             Ab                  Ab+/C
 So, goodbye Mary,       goodbye Jane. (Goodbye Mary,       Goodbye Jane.)
             Fm                  Ab7/Gb
     Will we ever          meet again? (Will we ever        meet again?)

#Verse 3
Ab                        Ab

Ab                        Abº
  Now some they do and    some they don't,
Db/Ab                     Ab
  And some you just can't tell.
Ab                        Abº
  And some they will and  some they won't.
Db/Ab                     Ab
  For some it's just as   well.


#Bridge 3
        Ab7/Gb
You can laugh at my behaviour.
        Fm7
That'll never bother me.
        Db
Say the Devil is my saviour.
        Bbm7
    But I don't pay no heed.

       Ab
   And I will go on shining.
       Ab7/Gb
       Shining like brand new.
       Db
  I'll never look behind me.
       Bbm7
    My troubles will be few.
