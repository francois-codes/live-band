#Verse 1
        Am            Dm
We were good, we were gold
        G                   C
Kind of dream that can't be sold
        Am            Dm
We were right 'til we weren't
        G                   C
Built a home and watched it burn


#Pre-Chorus
     Am                        Dm
Mmm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
 E7
Started to cry but then remembered, I


#Chorus
Am               Dm
I can buy myself flowers
G                     C   C/B
 Write my name in the sand
Am                  Dm
 Talk to myself for hours
G                           C   C/B
 Say things you don't understand
Am                 Dm
 I can take myself dancing
G                      C   C/B
 And I can hold my own hand
            F              E7       Am
Yeah, I can love me better than you can


#Post-Chorus
                    Dm
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
G                    C             C/B
 Can love me better, I can love me better, baby


#Verse 2
         Am            Dm
Paint my nails, cherry red
          G              C   Cmaj7
Match the roses that you left
     Am          Dm
No remorse, no regret
     G                  C   Cmaj7
I forget every word you said


#Pre-Chorus
     Am                              Dm
Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby, I didn't wanna fight
 E7
Started to cry but then remembered I


#Chorus
Am               Dm

Am                  Dm
 Talk to myself for hours
G                           C   C/B
 Say things you don't understand
Am                 Dm
 I can take myself dancing, yeah
G                      C   C/B
 And I can hold my own hand
            F              E7       Am
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
