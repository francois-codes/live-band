# Refrain
     C7
They tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no
C7
Yes I've been black and when I come back, you'll know, know, know
G7
I ain't got the time
          F7
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
     C7	                       F7            C7
They tried to make me go to re - hab I won't go, go, go

# Couplet 1
Em7                        Am7
     I'd rather be at home    with Ray
F                            Ab
     I ain't got seventy da - ys
            Em7                                  Am7
Cos there's no  - thing, there's nothing you can teach me
F                          Ab
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway

G7
     Didn't get a lot in class
      F7
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

# Couplet 2
Em7                                     Am7
     The man said "why do you think you     here ?"
F                Ab
I said "I got no idea"
    Em7                      Am7
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
F                  Ab
So I always keep a bottle near

G7
He said "I just think you're depressed"
F7
Kiss me, here baby  and go rest

# Couplet 3
Em7                             Am7
     I don't ever want to drink     again
F                Ab
I just, ooh just need a friend
Em7                         Am7
     I'm not gonna spend ten    weeks
F                       Ab
Have everyone think I'm    on the mend

G7
     It's not just my pride
F7
It's just till these tears have dried
