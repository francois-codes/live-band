#Verse 1
Fm       Cm     Db             Eb        Fm
You're a song written by the hands of God
Fm            Cm      
Don't get me wrong cause
Db                  Eb     Edim   
This might sound to you a bit odd

Fm       Eb     Db
But you own the place
Eb          Edim        Fm   Eb
Where all my thoughts go hiding
    Bbm              
And right under your clothes
Eb                
Is where I find them

#Chorus
Ab   Ab/C          Db   
Underneath your clothes
            Eb
There's an endless story
Ab          Ab/C     Db
There's the man i chose
            Eb
There's my territory
   Cm               Fm
Of all the things i deserve
    Bbm           Ebsus4_Eb     |  Ab    | Db     |
For being such a good girl Honey

'Cause of you I forgot the smart ways to lie
           Cm        Db            Eb     Edim
Because of you I'm running out of reasons to cry
Fm       Eb           Db
When the friends are gone
Eb       Edim  Fm  Eb
When the party's over
Bbm                   Eb                
We will still belong to each other

#Bridge (modulation)
  B                          B/F#        
I love you more than all that's on the planet
G#m                             F#
Movin’, talkin’, walkin’, breathin’
      E
You know it's true, oh babe it's so funny
          F#
You almost don't believe it

     B                      B/F#     
As every voice is hanging from the silence
G#m                                    F#
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
E
Like a lady tied to her manners
F#                             Fm
I'm tied up to this feeling
