#Intro
| Am7    | Am7    |


#Verse 1
| Am7           |   Dm7
Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
| G13         | Cmaj7
you love me no longer, I know
   | Am7          | Dm7
and maybe there is nothing that I can do
| G13         | Cmaj7
    to make you do

| Am7       | Dm7
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
| G13          | Cmaj7            Am7
that I ought to stick to another man
| Am7        | Dm7
    a man that surely deserves me
| G13
    but I think you do!

#Pre-chorus
| Cmaj7  C#dim7  | Dm7      D#dim7   | Eaug        |
                    So I cry, and I pray and I beg

#Chorus
| Amaj7   Dmaj7 | Bm7         E13
Love me love me, say that you love me
| Amaj7   Dmaj7 | Bm7      E13
fool me fool me,  go on and fool me
| Amaj7   Dmaj7    | Bm7          E13
love me love me, pretend that you love me
| Amaj7       Dmaj7    | Bm7          E13
leave me leave me , just say that you need me

| F#m7  |  Bm7   | E13   | Amaj7
      So I cried    and I begged for you to
| Amaj7   Dmaj7 | Bm7         E13
Love me love me, say that you love me
| Amaj7       Dmaj7   | Bm7           E13
leave me leave me, just say that you need me
| A     Dm       | Eaug       | Am7  | Am7
I can't care 'bout anything but you...


#Verse 2
| Am7       | Dm7
Lately I have desperately pondered,
| G13            | Cmaj7
spent my nights awake and I wonder
| Am7           | Dm7           | G13
what I could have done in another way
          | Cmaj7
to make you stay

| Am7           | Dm7
Reason will not lead to solution
| G13       | Cmaj7
I will end up lost in confusion
| Am7              | Dm7
    I don't care if you really care
| G13
    as long as you don't go


#Pre-chorus
| Cmaj7  C#dim7  | Dm7      D#dim7   | Eaug        |
                    So I cry, and I pray and I beg

#Chorus
| Amaj7   Dmaj7 | Bm7         E13
Love me love me, say that you love me
| Amaj7   Dmaj7 | Bm7      E13
fool me fool me,  go on and fool me
| Amaj7   Dmaj7    | Bm7          E13
love me love me, pretend that you love me
| Amaj7       Dmaj7    | Bm7          E13
leave me leave me , just say that you need me

| F#m7  |  Bm7   | E13   | Amaj7
      So I cried    and I begged for you to
| Amaj7   Dmaj7 | Bm7         E13
Love me love me, say that you love me
| Amaj7       Dmaj7   | Bm7           E13
leave me leave me, just say that you need me

| A     Dm       | Eaug       | Amaj7  Dmaj7 | Bm7  E13   |
I can't care 'bout anything but you...        (anything but you)
| Amaj7   Dmaj7 | Bm7  E13   |

| Amaj7  Dmaj7  | Bm7               E13   |
(Love me love me) Say that you love me

I can't care 'bout anything but you...
