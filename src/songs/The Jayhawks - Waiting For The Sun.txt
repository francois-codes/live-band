#VERSE 1:
Am       Am/G      F       F
   I was waiting for the sun
Am        Am/G       F      F
   Then I walked on home alone
Am        Am/G       F   F
   What I didn’t know
              D
   Was he was waiting for
   F
   You to fall

#VERSE 2:
Am      Am/G     F    F
   So I never made amends
Am         Am/G     F     F
   For the sake of no one else
Am         Am/G     F     F
   For the simple reason

   Was he was waiting for
   F
   You to fall

C                      G

Lookin’ for a friend to hand out
C                G
Somebody’s my soul

#VERSE 3:
Am     Am/G     F           F
   So I kept my spirits high
Am      Am/G      F     F
   Entertaining passers-by
Am          Am/G  F     F
   Right to my confusion

   Was he was waiting for
