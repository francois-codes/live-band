By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down

Ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion.

#chorus
C
By the rivers of Babylon, (dark tears of Babylon)
C
there we sat down (you got to sing a song)
         G7    
Ye-eah we wept, (sing a song of love)
                    C
when we remembered Zion. (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

C
By the rivers of Babylon, (rough bits of Babylon)
C
there we sat down (you hear the people cry)
         G7    
Ye-eah we wept, (they need their god)
                    C
when we remembered Zion. (ooh, have the power)
