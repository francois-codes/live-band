#Intro
| D  Bm  | F#m     | A      |

#Verse
D                 Bm               F#m
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
     Em7                                A7
They slither while they pass they slip away across the universe
D                 Bm              F#m
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind
  Em7            Gm
Possessing and caressing me

#Chorus
D             A7
Jai Guru Deva Om
A               A7        A7
Nothing's gonna change my world
G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world
A               A7        A7
Nothing's gonna change my world
G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world

#Verse
D         Bm                 F#m                             Em7
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
                        A7
They call me on and on across the Universe.
D                Bm              F#m
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
      Em7                              A7
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the Universe.

#Chorus
D             A7
Jai Guru Deva Om
A               A7        A7
Nothing's gonna change my world
G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world
A               A7        A7
Nothing's gonna change my world
G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world

#Verse
D                    Bm                 F#m
Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing through my opened ears
  Em7          Gm
Inciting and inviting me.
D            Bm               F#m                             Em7
Limitless, undying love which shines around me like a million suns
                        A7
And calls me on and on across the Universe

#Chorus
D             A7
Jai Guru Deva Om
A               A7        A7
Nothing's gonna change my world
G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world
A               A7        A7
Nothing's gonna change my world
G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world
