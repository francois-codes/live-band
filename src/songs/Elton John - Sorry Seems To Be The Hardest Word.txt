#Intro
| Gm/F    Gm/E   | Gm/Eb    Gm/D   |

| Cm             | D7sus4   D7      |


#Verse 1
Gm           Bb/F            |  Cm9       |
What I gotta do to make you love me?
F                         |  Bb       Adim_D7m9 |
What I gotta do to make you care?
Gm                      |  Cm9       |
What I do when lightning strikes me
F                                 |  Bb       Adim_D7m9 |
and I wake to find that you're not there?


#Verse 2
Gm           Bb/F         |  Cm9       |
What I gotta do to make you want me?
F                   |  Bb       Adim_D7m9 |
What I gotta do to be heard?
Gm                       |  Cm9       |
What do I say when it's all over?
F                                |  Bb       Bb/A |
And "sorry" seems to be the hardest word


#Chorus
<Eb/G     D/F#
It's sad,   so sad
Bb/F              Em7b5
It's a sad sad situation,
Cm/Eb            D            |  Gm       Adim_D7m9 |
and it's getting more and more absurd,
<Eb/G     D/F#
It's sad,   so sad
Bb/F              Em7b5
Why can't we talk it over?
Cm7
Oh, it seems to me
       Cm7            D7               (Gm)
that "sorry" seems to be the hardest word.

What do I do when lightning strikes me?
Am7b5           D7
What do I gotta do?
Gm                 Cm
What have I gotta do
Am7b5                  D7             (Gm/F)
when "sorry" seems to be the hardest word?
