#Intro
Bmaj7 B7    Emaj7
   Do do do do, mmm-mmm-mmm,
Bmaj7 B7        Emaj7
   Do do do, do do do.

#Verse 1
     Bmaj7              B7                   Emaj7
As a-round the sun, the earth knows she's re-volving,
        Bmaj7                           A7
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May.
        Bmaj7                 B7            Emaj7          E6
Just as hate knows love's the cure; you can rest your mind assure,
     G#m7           A#m7 D#7 G#m7 G#m6 C#m F#7
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.

#Verse 2
       Bmaj7            B7            Emaj7
As now can't reveal the mystery of to-morrow,
       Bmaj7                         A7
But in passing will grow older every day.
        Bmaj7              B7            Emaj7         E6
Just as all that's born is new, you know what I say is true;
     G#m7           A#m7 D#7 G#m
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.

#Chorus 1
G#m        D#aug             G#m7             C#7
 Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky, (always).
G#m        D#aug        G#m7           C#7
 Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (always).
G#m        D#aug              G#m7            C#7
 Until the dolphin flies, and parrots live at sea, (always).
G#m       D#aug             G#m7           F9
 Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream.

#Bridge 1
Emaj7                                 Bmaj7
 Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Emaj7                         A7
 Her acceptance is the way we pay.
Emaj7                             Bmaj7
 Did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
                    C#m7         D#sus D# C#m9 F#13
To last through for-ever another day.

#Verse 3
        Bmaj7             B7              Emaj7
Just as time knew to move on since the be-ginning,
        Bmaj7                        A7
And the seasons know exactly when to change.
        Bmaj7             B7                   Emaj7            E6
Just as kindness knows no shame; know through all your joy and pain;
     G#m7           A#m7 D#7 G#m7 G#m6 C#m F#7
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.

#Verse 4
      Bmaj7          B7             Emaj7
As to-day I know I'm living, but to-morrow;
           Bmaj7                           Amaj7
Could make me the past; but that I mustn't fear.
         Bmaj7           B7                Emaj7           E6
For I'll know deep in my mind; the love of me I've left be-hind;;
     G#m7           A#m7 D#7 G#m
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.

#Chorus 2
G#m        D#aug            G#m7              C#7
 Until the day is night and night becomes the day, (always)
G#m        D#aug              G#m7         C#7
 Until the trees and sea just up and fly a-way, (always)
G#m        D#aug      G#m7   C#7
 Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, (always)
G#m        D#aug            G#m7            C#7
 Until the day, that is the day that are no more, (Did you know that you're loved by somebody?)

G#m        D#aug                G#m7             C#7
 Until the day the earth starts turning right to left, (always)
G#m        D#aug              G#m7           C#7
 Until the earth just for the sun, denies it-self, (I've been loving you for ever)
G#m         D#aug         G#m7             C#7
 Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through, (always)
G#m        D#aug            G#m7        C#7
 Until the day that you are me and I am you, (alwaaaaaaaaaaays)

G#m        D#aug             G#m7             C#7
 Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (yeahyeahyeahyeah)
G#m        D#aug        G#m7           C#7
 Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (always)

#Instrumental
G#m         D#aug        G#m7           C#7 (4x)


#Break
       G#m        D#aug                  G#m7     C#7
We all know, some-times life's hates and troubles,
             G#m                     D#aug           G#m7  C#7
Can make you wish you were born in a-nother time and space.
            G#m      D#aug       G#m7                 C#7
But you can bet your life, times that, and twice it's double;
               G#m            D#aug            G#m7   C#7
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed.
        G#m                       G#aug          G#m7  C#7
So make sure, when you say you're in it, but not of it,

           G#m                  D#aug                          G#m7 C#7
You're not helping to make this Earth a place sometimes called Hell.
            G#m        D#aug                        G#m7       C#7
Change your words into truths, and then change that truth into love,
              G#m
And maybe our children's grandchildren,
          D#aug                          G#m7 C#7
And their great-great grandchildren will tell.

G#m        D#aug             G#m7             C#7

 Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky, (loving you).
G#m        D#aug        G#m7           C#7
 Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (I've got to say always).
