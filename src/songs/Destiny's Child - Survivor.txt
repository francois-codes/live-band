Now that you are out of my life, I'm so much better,
                    |  D#7                    |  G#m
You thought that I'd be weak without ya, But I'm stronger,
    D#7             |    G#m                   |   C#m7

                    |   D#7                      |    G#m
You thought that I'd be helpless without ya, But I'm smarter,
    D#7             |    G#m                      |    C#m7
You thought that I'd be stressed without ya, But I'm chillin'
                    |  D#7                    |   G#m
You thought I wouldn't sell without ya, Sold nine million.
