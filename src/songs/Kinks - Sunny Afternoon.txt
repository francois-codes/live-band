     Dm                  C7
The      taxman's taken      all my dough
     F                 C7
And     left me in my     stately home
A         A/G        A/F         A/E          Dm
   Lazin'      on a       sunny      after -      noon
Dm               C7
    And I can't     sail my yacht
      F                C7
He's     taken every -      thing I've got
A            A/G           A/F         A/E          Dm       (Dm)
   All I've      got this       sunny      after -      noon


#Chorus
D                     D7                    G7
   Save me, save me,     save me from this      squeeze
              C7                            F      A7
I got a big      fat mama, tryin' to break     me
       Dm                   G
And I      love to live so     pleasantly
Dm                     G7        C
    Live this life of     luxu -     ry
F               A7                Dm         Dm/C - Dm/B - Dm/Bb
   Lazin' on a     sunny after -      noon
      A             A/G       A/F - A/E
In a     summer -       time
      Dm           Dm/C       Dm/B - Dm/Bb
In a     summer -       time

In a     summer -       time

    Dm                       C7
My     girlfriend's run off     with my car
     F                     C7
And     gone back to her      ma and pa
A           A/G          A/F             A/E          Dm
   Tellin'      tales of      drunken -      ness and     cruelty
Dm           C7
    Now I'm     sittin' here
F                 C7
   Sippin' at my      ice-cooled beer
A          A/G        A/F         A/E          Dm       (Dm)

   Help me, help me,      help me sail a -     way
            C7
Or give me     two good reasons -
               F        A7
why I oughta     stay
          Dm                  G
'Cause I     love to live so     pleasantly
