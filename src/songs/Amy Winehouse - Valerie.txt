#Verse 1
         Ebmaj7                                         Fm7
Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
      Ebmaj7
And I think of all the things,
                                          Fm7
What you're doing and in my head I make a picture


#Chorus
       Abmaj7                            Gm7
'cause since I've come on home , well my body's been a mess
         Abmaj7                          Gm7
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Abmaj7                      Gm7                 Bb7
Won't you come on over stop making a fool out of me
                           Ebmaj7       Fm7
Why won't you come on over Valerie? Valerie?
    Ebmaj7   Fm7

        Ebmaj7
Did you have to go to jail, put your house up for sale,
                   Fm7
Did you get a good lawyer?
           Ebmaj7
I hope you didnâ€™t catch a tan
                                                   Fm7
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it up for ya
        Ebmaj7
Are you shoppin' anywhere,
                                          Fm7
Changed the colour of your hair , are you busy?
            Ebmaj7
And did you have to pay the fine
                                            Fm7
you were dodging all the time are you still dizzy


#Chorus
       Abmaj7                            Gm7
'cause since I've come on home , well my body's been a mess
         Abmaj7                          Gm7
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Abmaj7                      Gm7                 Bb7
Won't you come on over stop making a fool out of me
                           Ebmaj7       Fm7
Why won't you come on over Valerie? Valerie?
