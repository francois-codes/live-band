#Intro
C    Em    Am7    G   (2x)


#Verse 1
          C                      Em         Am7       G
When you try your best but you don't succeed,
          C                      Em         Am7       G
When you get what you want, but not what you need,
          C                  Em             Am7       G
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep,
           C   Em   Am7   G
Stuck in reverse.

#Verse 2
          C                  Em           Am7        G
And the tears come streaming down your face,
          C                  Em           Am7        G
When you lose something you can't replace,
          C                 Em            Am7        G
When you love someone but it goes to waste,
             C    Em    Am7   G         F
Could it be worse?

#Chorus
F       C    G           F
Lights will guide you home,
F   C  G            F
And ignite your bones,
F      C   G
And I will try to fix you,

#Instrumental
C    Em    Am7    G   (2x)


#Verse 3
  C                Em       Am7        G
High up above or down below,
             C              Em       Am7       G
When you're too in love to let it go,
             C              Em        Am7      G
But if you never try you'll never know,
                  C    Em   Am7   G       F
Just what you're worth.

#Chorus
F       C    G           F
Lights will guide you home,
F   C  G            F
And ignite your bones,
F      C   G
And I will try to fix you.

#Instrumental

| Am7 |  F   | C   | G   |

| C   |  F   | C   | Em   |

| Am7 |  F   | C   | G   |


#Bridge
C            F
Tears stream, down your face,
C                       G
When you lose something you cannot replace.
Am7          F                  C   G
Tears stream, down your face and I ......

C            F
Tears stream, down your face,
C                    Em
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes.
Am7          F                  C   G
Tears stream, down your face and I ......

#Chorus (single strumming)
F       C    G           F
Lights will guide you home,
F   C  G            F
And ignite your bones,
F      C   G               C
And I will try to fix you.
