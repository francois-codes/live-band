G              Gmaj7            G6              Edim            Am     D7
Just a gigolo, Everywhere I go, People know the part, I'm playing
D                                                         G
Paid for every dance, Selling each romance, Ooh what they saying
G7                         F                   E7                          Am
There will come a day when youth will pass away, Then what will they say about me
Am                  Cm                G      E7
When the end comes I know, They'll say just a gigolo,
Am           D7         G
As life goes on without me

G              Gmaj7            G6              Edim            Am     D7
Just a gigolo, Everywhere I go, People know the part, I'm playing
D                                                         G
Paid for every dance, Selling each romance, Ooh what they saying

There will come a day when youth will pass away, Then what will they say about me
Am                  Cm                G      E7
When the end comes I know, They'll say just a gigolo,
Am           D7         G
As life goes on without me

D7
Cause I aint so bad
