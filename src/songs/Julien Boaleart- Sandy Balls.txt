              C                         Am  
Sandy sandy balls, my balls are always sandy (so sandy)

Sandy sandy balls, They're salty and they're crunchy (so crunchy)
   F                   G         F             G
I like them like they are, They make me feel alive,

I like the feeling of sand On my balls

#verse 1
              C                         Am  
Sandy sandy balls, They're sandy in the morning (in the morning)
             C                                 Am
Sandy sandy balls, They're sandy through the night
C                                             Am  
Let me explain to you why, it starts with the feet
                    C                   Am  
When I walk on the beach yeah, with my feet
            C                                  Am  
And then I put on some underwear, cause I was naked (he was naked)

        C                                  
And the sand that has stuck to my feet yeah,
           Am
It falls straight to the bottom of my slip,
             C
And from the slip I'm sure you know
                  Am
what body part it sticks to, Oh don't you know

#Chorus
              C                         Am  
Sandy sandy balls, My balls are oh so sandy (so sandy)
             C                           Am
Sandy sandy balls, They're salty sandy crunchy (sandy crunchy)
    F                  G         F                    G
Now if you don't have balls I'm sure you can still relate
      F           G               | C    | G    |
With some other body part Than the balls

              C                         Am  
Sandy sandy balls, It's all about the feeling (so sandy)
              C                         Am  
Sandy sandy balls, They're really universal (sandy crunchy)
