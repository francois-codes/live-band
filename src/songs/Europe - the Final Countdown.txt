    We're leaving together,
                Bm
But still it's farewell
F#m
    And maybe we'll come back,
   E/G#     A
To earth, who can tell?

  I guess there is no one to blame

  We're leaving ground  (leaving ground)

#Verse
F#m
    We're heading for Venus
               Bm
and still we stand tall
F#m
    Cause maybe they've seen us
    E/G#     A
and welcome us all
D              E
  With so many light years to go
A     E/G#         F#m     E     D
  and things to be found  (to be found)
                    C#m           E
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.


#Chorus
               F#m        D      Bm      E
It's the final countdown...

     The final countdown...
