#chorus
C          Am           F
Whoa, my love,  my darling
   G                         C
I've hungered for your touch
  Am           G
Alone lonely times
      C         Am      F
And time goes by so slowly
       G                C
And time can do so much
      Am        G       G
Are you still mine ?

#bridge
F              G            F
Lonely rivers flow to the sea
        Eb
To the sea
F              G           C
To the open arms of the sea
F              G              F
Lonely rivers sigh wait for me

         Eb
Wait for me
F                 G
I'll be coming home.
        C
Wait for me

Whoa my love,  my darling

I've hungered, hungered for your touch
Am              G
For love lonely times
      C        Am        F
And time goes by so slowly

And time can do so much
