Em                 D        Bm                  Em
Do you see the face on the TV screen coming at you every Sunday
Em                 D         Bm         Em
See the face on the billboard, that man is me
Em                 D        Bm                 Em
On the cover of the magazine, there's no question why I'm smiling
Em                D        Bm                Em
You buy a piece of paradise, you buy a piece of me


#Pre-Chorus
D              E
   I'll get you everything you wanted (oohoh)
D              E
   I'll get you everything you need (oohoh)
D                 E                          D              E
   Don't need to believe in hereafter (oohoh), just believe in me


#Chorus
     Am      D               G        C
'cos Jezus He knows me, and He knows I'm right
Am                  D    G     C
I've been talking to Jezus all my life
Am        D               G        C
Oh yes, He knows me, and He knows I'm right
Am           D         E
And He's been telling me everything's (gonna be) alright


#Verse
Em              D     Bm                     Em
I believe in the family     with my ever loving wife beside me
Em                         D                Bm            Em
But she don't know about my girlfriend or the man I met last night
Em       D           Bm             Em
Do you believe in God,     'cos that's what I'm selling
Em                    D      Bm          Em
And if you wanna go to heaven, I'll see you right


#Pre-Chorus
D                        E
   You won't ever have to leave your house (oohoh)
D        E
   Or get out of your chair (oohoh)
D                        E                       D            E
   You don't even have to touch that dial (oohoh), 'cos I'm everywhere


#Chorus
     Am      D               G        C
'cos Jezus He knows me, and He knows I'm right
Am                  D    G     C
I've been talking to Jezus all my life
Am        D               G        C
Oh yes, He knows me, and He knows I'm right
Am           D         E
And He's been telling me everything's (gonna be) alright

G#m            B         D#m       G#m
Won't find me practising what I'm preaching
G#m            B        D#m   G#m
Won't find me making no sacrifice
G#m        B        D#m           G#m
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles
G#m                   B    D#m        G#m
If you promise to be good, try to be nice
A                         G#m
God will take good care of you
     A                         Bsus
Just do as I say, don't do as I do              -- keys#Bb

You can find me in the phone book,   just call my toll free number
