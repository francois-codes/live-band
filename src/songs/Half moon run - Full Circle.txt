#Verse 1
Bbmaj7#11
Cap off kneeling at the back of the church,
        Am
Feeling water on your brow, if it's healing it hurts
   Gm6
At first a sharpish pain that returns as a thought
         Dmadd9/A
That the needle in your skin will bring you closer to god
     Dm             Fmaj7          | C      |  C     |
And I watch as your head turns full circle


#Verse 2
Bbmaj7#11
Our hope was with a coffee and a medical text
         Am
It's too easy knowin' nothing blowing off the rest
        Gm6
And the riddles in the pages leave at too much to guess
        Dmadd9/A
And the worry cracks a fracture from your hip to your chest
     Dm            Fmaj7           | C      |  C     |
As I watch as your head turns full circle

#Verse 3
Bbmaj7#11
We got lost in the travels in the spiritual book
           Am
Missed the beaches from nirvana and the way that they look
        Gm6
And the crooks they're on the island they're killin' to keep runnin'
                Dmadd9/A
They're running severance on the plastic and it seems to be working
            Dm        Fmaj7 C
Is that the best that I can do?
     Dm            Fmaj7           C
As I watch as your head turns full circle

#Verse 4
      Bbmaj7#11
You appear even-tempered though your looks will deceive
        Am
And the sparks are always flying cause you drink for relief
         Gm6
With the heart of a child and the wit of a fool
         Dmadd9/A
It's a wonder why I donâ€™t try to build a wall around you
       Dm            Fmaj7           | C      | C      |
When I watch as your head turns full circle

      Dm            Fmaj7           C
And I watch as your head turns full circle
        Dm            Fmaj7           C
Yeah, I watch as your head turns full circle
