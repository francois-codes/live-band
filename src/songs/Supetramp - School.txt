#Intro Harmonica

#Verse 1
Am                                          Em
I can see you in the morning when you go to school.
G                                                         Dm
Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the golden rule.
Am                                                    Em
Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work,
    G                                         Dm
And be like Johnny Toogood. Don't you know he never shirks.

He's coming along.

#Verse 2
Am                                          Em/A
After school is over, you're playing in the park.
G/A                                 Dm/A        F/A
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark.
     Am                                         Em/A
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about.
    G/A                                   Dm/A     F/A
And grow up just like them, won't let you work it out.
           C       E
And you're full of doubt.

#Chorus
E                  Am
Don't do this, and don't do that.
Am
What are they tryin' to do?
D/A
Make a good boy of you.
Am           D          E
Do they know where it's at?

      E                  Am
Don't criticise, they're old and wise.
Am
Do as they tell you to.
D/A
Don't want the devil to
Am            D
Come and pull out your
|E      |A/E     |B/E     |A/E      |
 eyes.

|E      |A/E     |B/E     |A/E      |


#Verse 3
Am                            Em/A
Maybe I'm mistaken, expecting you to fight.
   G/A                                Dm/A          F/A
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right.
    Am                                    Em/A
But while I'm still living, I've just got this to say.
     G/A                            Am
It's always up to you, if you wanna be that,
F/A                   C           E
Wanna see that, wanna see it that way.
               Am9 .........
You're coming along.
