When your rooster crows at the break of dawn

 Look out your window and I'll be gone

  I'm on the dark side of the road
        E                                 E7
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
   A                         F#7/A#
To try and make me change my mind and stay

So, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
A                       E       B

       E               B              C#m         C#m/B # F#7/A#
And It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F#7/A#                B     B7
  I can't hear you anymore
      E                        E7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
  A                      F#7/A#
I once loved aw woman, a child I'm told
  E           B             C#m    C#m/B A
I gave her my heart but she wanted my   soul

#Verse 4
   E  B          C#m
So lo-ong, honey babe
C#m/B     A              E       B
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
    E         B          C#m         C#m/B # F#7/A#
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
F#7/A#                       B     B7
  So I'll just say fare thee well
E                          E7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    A                         F#7/A#
You could have done better but I don't mind
E              B        C#m C#m/B    A
You just kinda wasted my    precious time
E/B         B              |2/4 E |
