     A7                                A7          (A7)
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
D                  G               C    C/B    Am
  Look around you, All you see are sympathetic eyes
E                             D
  Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
G               Em                 C               D
Jesus loves you more than you will know  Woah woah woah

  Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
A7                                A7
  Put it in you pantry with your cupcakes
D                G                C    C/B     Am
   It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
E                             D
   Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids

  Going to the candidates' debate YEAH!
D                 G              C           C/B    Am
  Laugh about it, shout about it when you've got to choose
E                              D
  Every way you look at it you lose

#chorus

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
  G                Em             C             D
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you   Ooo ooo ooo
                G         Em
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?
G                Em             C               Am            E
