            Bb                   Cm7/Bb
   From the day we arrive on the planet
    F7/A                     Bb		Bb/A
And blinking, step into the sun
        Gm                   Cm
There's more to see than can ever be seen
        Ab                  Fsus4  F
More to do than can ever be done
        Bb                   Cm7/Bb
There's far too much to take in here
        F7/A                   Bb
More to find than can ever be found
        Gm
But the sun rolling high
            Cm7
Through the sapphire sky
                Ab                   Fsus4 F
Keeps great and small on the endless round

#Chorus
F                Bb    Eb Bb
It's the Circle of Life
Bb              Ab/Bb
And it moves us all
Ab                   Eb   Ab/Eb Eb
Through despair and hope
Eb                Fsus4  F
Through faith and love
F                  Bb/D  G7
  Till we find our place
G7            Cm
On the path unwinding
Ebm6/F#           Bb       Fsus4
           In the Circle
    F7    Eb      Bb
The Circle of Life
