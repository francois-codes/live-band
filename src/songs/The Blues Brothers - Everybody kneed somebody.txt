Were so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight, and we would especially like
%
to welcome all the representatives of Illinois' law enforcement community who have chosen to
%
join us here in the palace hotel ballroom at this time. We certainly hope you all enjoy the
%
show, and remember people, that no matter who you are and what you do to live, thrive and
%
survive, there're still some things that make us all the same. You, me, them, everybody, everybody.
