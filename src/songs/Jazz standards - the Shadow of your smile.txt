#verse A
    Em             F#m7        B7b9     Em7     
The shadow of your smile, when you are gone,  
<A7                Am7        D7        Gmaj7    
Will colour all my dreams and light the dawn.  
<Cmaj7       F#m7b5   B7b9       Em7      
Look into my eyes, my love, and see,
<Em7/D         C#m7b5     F#7b9   F#m7b5   B7b13
All the lovely things you are, to me.  

#verse B
    Em             F#m7        B7b9     Em7     
Our wistful little star,   was far too high,
<A7                Am7        D7        B7b5    
A teardrop kissed your lips, and so did I.  
<E7b9        Am7          Cm7   F7                  Bm7               
Now when I remember spring,       all the joy that love can bring,  
<E7B13       Am      D7sus4   D7b9          G6
I will be remembering, The Shadow of your smile
