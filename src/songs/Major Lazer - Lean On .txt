#Verse 1
| Ebmaj7        F          | Gm
Do you recall, not long ago
           Bb               |  Ebmaj7
We would walk on the sidewalk?
         F        |  Gm
Innocent, remember?
Gm                               |  Ebmaj7
All we did was care for each other


#Pre-Chorus 1
             F
But the night was warm
| Gm          Bb       |  Ebmaj7
And we were bold and young
           F
All around, the wind blows
| Gm
We would only hold on to let go


#Chorus
| Ebmaj7      F
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
| Gm          Bb
We need someone to lean on
| Ebmaj7      F
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
| Gm
All we need is somebody to lean on

| Ebmaj7      F
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
| Gm          Bb
We need someone to lean on
| Ebmaj7      F
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
| N.C.
All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old?
Gm           Bb            |   Ebmaj7
Will we walk down the same road?
Ebmaj7           F        |  Gm
Will you be there by my side?
Gm                               |  Ebmaj7
Standing strong as the waves roll over


#Pre-Chorus 2
Ebmaj7           F
When the nights are long

Longing for you to come home

All around, the wind blows

We would only hold on to let go
