#Verse
      Am                       B/A
Oh, I come from a land, from a far away place
          Bb/E           Am
Where the caravan camels roam
           Cm                       D/C
Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face
     E7b9                   Am
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

         F7                           Am
When the wind's from the east and the sun's from the west
        F7                   E7sus
And the sand in the glass is right
E7      Am                      B/A
Come on down, stop on by, hop a carpet and fly
     E7sus   E7     Am
To another Arabian night

#Chorus
          Cm       Am
Arabian nights
             Am       Cm
Like Arabian days
                Am       Em          Am
More often than not, are hotter than hot
     F7          E
In a lot of good ways

          Am        Cm
Arabian nights
               Am       Cm
'Neath Arabian moons
              Am           Em7           Am
A fool of his guard, could fall and fall hard
    F7      E7   Am6
Out there on the dunes
