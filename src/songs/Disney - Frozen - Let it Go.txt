#Intro
| Fm    Db   | Eb  Bbm  |

| Fm    Db   | Eb  Bbm  |


#Verse 1
  | Fm                      Db
The snow blows white on the mountain tonight
  | Eb               Bbm
Not a footprint to be seen
|  Fm         Ab            | Eb                 Bb
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the Queen
| Fm          Cm             | Eb             Bbm
 The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
| Fm                 | Eb              Bb
 Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

#pre-chorus
| Eb
 Don't let them in, don't let them see
| Db
Be the good girl you always had to be
| Eb                               |  Db
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

Well, now they know

#chorus
     | Ab         Eb
Let it go, let it go
    | Fm               Db
Can't hold it back anymore
     | Ab        Eb
Let it go, let it go
    | Fm              Db
Turn away and slam the door
| Ab      Eb            | Fm         Db
I don’t care what they’re going to say
      | Cm          B
Let the storm rage on
  | Db                           | Ab  Eb
The cold never bothered me anyway

#Verse 2
   | Fm             Db
It's funny how some distance
    | Eb               Bbm
Makes everything seem small
      | Fm              Eb
And the fears that once controlled me
     | Bb
Can't get to me at all
    | Eb
It’s time to see what I can do
| Db
   To test the limits and break through
| Eb                             | Db
  No right, no wrong, no rules for me
           | (2/4) Db
I’m free

#Chorus
     | Ab         Eb
Let it go, let it go
  | Fm                    Db
I am one with the wind and sky
     | Ab        Eb
Let it go, let it go
     | Fm           Db
You’ll never see me cry
| Ab     Eb
Here I stand
  | Fm        Db
And here I'll stay
       | Cm          B        
Let the storm rage on

#Instrumental
| Dbsus4   Db   | Dbsus4   Db   |

#Bridge
| Db                              | Db
   My powers flurries through the air into the ground
| Db                       | Db
   My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
| Eb                           | Eb
  And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
| Fm         Db           | Eb            Bbm   | (2/4) Db
  I’m never going back, the past is the past

#Outro
    | Ab         Eb
Let it go, let it go
   | Fm                     Db
I’ll rise like the break of dawn
     | Ab         Eb
Let it go, let it go
   | Fm              Db
That perfect girl is gone
| Ab     Eb
Here I stand
    | Fm        Db  | (2/4) Db
In the light of day
      | Cm         B | (2/4) B |
Let the storm rage on
 | Db
The cold never bothered me anyway
