#Verse 1
Fm
Folks, here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher,
Db7                  C7      Fm
  She was a low-down hoochie-cootcher,
Fm
  She was the roughest, toughest frail,
    Db7                   C7       Fm
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale.


#Chorus

      Fm
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho!)


#Verse 2
Fm
  She messed around with a bloke named Smoky,
Db7                    C7     Fm
  She loved him though he was cokie,
Fm
  He took her down to Chinatown,
       Db7                        C7    Fm
And he showed her how to kick the gong around.

#Verse 3
Fm
  She had a dream about the king of Sweden,
Db7                       C7      Fm
  He gave her things that she was needin',
Fm
  He gave her a home built of gold and steel,
#(Double time feel)
  Db7                C7       Fm
A diamond car with a platinum wheel.


#Chorus

#Verse 4
Fm
  He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses,
Db7                       C7    Fm
  Each meal she ate was a dozen courses;
Fm
  She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
    Db7                               C7      Fm
She sat around and counted them all a million times.


#Chorus
