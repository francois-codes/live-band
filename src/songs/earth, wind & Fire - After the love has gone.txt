#Intro
F   F/A    Bb   C  (2x)


#Verse 1
     F        Bbm/F                 F
For awhile to love was all we could do
        F/A
We were young and we knew
        Dm7        BbMaj7
And our eyes were alive
       Eb7              C7
Deep inside we knew our love was true

     F        Bbm/F               F
For awhile we paid no mind to the past
        F/A
We knew love would last
      Dm7             Bb
Every night somethin' right
        Gm7/C        C7
Would invite us to begin the dance


#Pre-Chorus
Bb/F                F/A      Dm7
Somethin' happened along the way
     Gm7                  F    B7
What used to be happy was sad

EMaj7                 B/Eb     G#m7
Somethin' happened along the way
    C#m7                 BMaj7
And yesterday was all we had


#Chorus
    Cm7 Fm7                Bbm7
And oh  after the love has gone
Bbm7/Eb               Abm7
How could you lead me on
    Abm7/Db          F#Maj7
And not let me stay around

Abm7 Bbm7 Cm7 Fm7                Bbm7
Oh   oh   oh  after the love has gone
     Bbm7/Eb             Abm7
What used to be right is wrong
    Abm7/Db             F#Maj7
Can love that's lost be found


#Verse 2
     F        Bbm/F                F
For awhile to love each other with all
         F/A
We would ever need
         Dm7           BbMaj7
Love was strong for so long
      Eb7
Never knew that what was
C7                   F
Wrong oh baby wasn't right

   Bbm/F                 F
We tried to find what we had
     F/A                Dm7
Till sadness was all we shared
        Bb          Gm7/C                 C7
We were scared this affair would lead our love into

#Pre-Chorus
Bb/F                F/A      Dm7
Somethin' happened along the way
Gm7                  F
Yesterday was all we had
Bb/F                F/A      Dm7
Somethin' happened along the way
     Gm7                 F   B7
What used to be happy is sad

#Change Key
EMaj7               B/Eb     G#m7

And yesterday was all we had
