#Verse 1
        Am     E7          Am
I went down to St.James Infirmary
Am        B°   E7
   Saw my baby there
          Am                E7          Am    D7
She was stretched out on a long, white table
    F7       E7       Am
So cold, so sweet, so fair


#Verse 2
        Am          E7      Am
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Am          F7     E7
   Wherever she may be
         Am        E7         Am    D7
She can look this wide world over
            F7               E7       Am
But she'll never find a sweet man like me


#Verse 3
       Am       E7                  Am
When I die bury me in strait laced shoes,
Am                        F7        E7
I want a Boxback coat and a Stetson hat
       Am               E7            Am         D7
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
        F7                  E7            Am
So the boys will know that I died standin' pat
