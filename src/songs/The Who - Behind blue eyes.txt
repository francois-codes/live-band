#Verse
Em                     G6
No one knows what it's like
          Dsus2
To be the bad man
          Cadd9
To be the sad man
  Asus2
Behind blue eyes

    Em                     G6
And no one knows what it's like
      Dsus2
To be hated
      Cadd9
To be fated
           Asus2
To telling only lies


#Chorus
       Cadd9    D
But my dreams.......
               G
They aren't as empty
      Cadd9      D        E   Esus4  E  Esus4   E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm          Cadd9
I have hours, only lonely
           D
My love is vengeance
             Asus2
That's never free


#Verse
Em                     G6
No one knows what it's like
              Dsus2
To feel these feelin's
       Cadd9
Like I do
            Asus2
And I blame you
   Em                G6
No one bites back as hard
         Dsus2
On their anger
           Cadd9
None of my pain an' woe
         Asus2
Can show through


#Chorus
        Cadd9   D
But my dreams.......
               G
They aren't as empty
      Cadd9      D        E   Esus4  E  Esus4   E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm          Cadd9
I have hours, only lonely
           D
My love is vengeance
             Asus2
That's never free



#Bridge
E   Bsus2   A

 E           Bsus2     A           E
When my fist clenches, crack it open
E        Bm         G        D
Before I use it and lose my cool
       Bsus2  A            D
When I smile, tell me some bad news
         Bm        A          E  Bsus2 A
Before I laugh and act like a fool
E        Bsus2   A        E
And if I swallow anything evil
E        Bm     G       D
Put your finger down my throat
         Bsus2          A         D
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
        Bm           A         E Bsus2 A
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat
