#Intro
| Am    Aaug   | Am    Aaug   |

#Verse 1
| Am            | A7aug
I can't give you all my dreams
| E/G#   E7/G# | Amsus2  Am  C/G
Nor the life I  live.
| Fmaj        | Esus4  E         Amsus2  Am  C/G
You and I know what  friendship means,
     | Cmaj7/E  D#dim7 | E7sus4  E7
That's all  we  got to  give.

#Verse 2
| Am            | Fmaj9   Fmaj7
Who will take your dreams away
| E/G#   E7/G#  | Amsus2  Am  C/G
Takes your soul another day.
| Fmaj       | Esus4  E    Amsus2  Am  C/G
What can never be lost is gone,
      | Cmaj7/E  D#dim7 | E7sus4  E7
They've stolen   it     away.

#Verse 3
| F             G      | Am
Please, don't stand too close to me,
| F      G     | C
Can you hear my heart?
| F             G      | Am
Take my warmth and lean on me
 Fadd4     D#dim7 | E7sus4  E7
When we're not   apart.

#Verse 4
| Am          | Fmaj9   Fmaj7
Now our mission is complete
| E/G#   E7/G#    | Amsus2  Am  C/G
And our friends are here
| Fmaj            | Esus4  E     Amsus2  Am  C/G
Evil things brought down by the light,
| Cmaj7/E  D#dim7 | E7sus4  E7  | Am
Life  goes  on   until     the  end.
