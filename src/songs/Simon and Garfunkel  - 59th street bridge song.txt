#Verse 1
         C         F               C
A winters day in a deep and dark december
Dm G7   F  C  Dm7            Em7  Dm7             Em7
I  am alone gazing from my window to the streets below on a
 Dm             F                G
freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
F       C   F       G7  Am
I am a rock I am an island

#Verse 2
            C        F                C          Dm      G7    F  C
Ive built walls a fortress deep and mighty that none may penetrate
   Dm7               Em7        Dm7             Em7
I have no need of friendship friendship causes pain
      Dm               F         G
Its laughter and its loving I disdain
F       C   F       G7  Am
I am a rock I am an island

#Verse 3
               C        F              C     Dm          G7      F  C
Dont talk of love Ive heard the word before Its sleeping in my memory
   Dm7                Em7       Dm7               Em7
I wont disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
       Dm            F                G
if I never loved I never would have cried
F       C   F       G7  Am
I am a rock I am an island

#Verse 4
            C            F          C               Dm    G7     F  C
I have my books and my poetry to protect me I am shielded in my armor
  Dm7         Em7  Dm7            Em7
hiding in my room safe within my womb
   Dm              F              G
I touch no one and no one touches me
F       C   F       G7  Am
I am a rock I am an island

#Verse 5
       Dm7   G7      C
And a rock feels no pain
        Dm7    G7     C
and an island never cries
