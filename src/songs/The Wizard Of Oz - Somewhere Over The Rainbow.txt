Somewhere        over the rainbow,  way up high

There's a    land that I heard of, once in a lul   la     by

G    Em   Bm                C         G
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
C   Cm   G              Em      Am7          D7      G
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
    Am7                              Em        Am7   D7
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
       G
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
  F#m
Away above the chimney tops
       Bm           Am7  D7
That's where you'll find me

G    Em   Bm                C         G
Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
C     Cm   G       Em       Am7          D7        G
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I?

    G                         Am7
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
        D         G
Why, oh why can't I?
