#Verse
F#m
Time, it needs time, to win back your love again.
          G#               C#  
I will be there, I will be there.
F#m  
Love, only love can bring back your love someday.
          G#               C#
I will be there, I will be there.

F#m
Fight, babe, I'll fight to win back your love again.
          G#               C#
I will be there, I will be there.
F#m   
Love, only love can break down the walls someday.
          G#                C#     
I will be there, I will be there.


#Chorus
F#m       D
  If we'd go again
 A                      E
  All the way from the start.
F#m      D   
  I would try to change
 A                           E
  The things that killed our love.
F#m              Bm               C#
  Your pride has build a wall, so strong

                   F#m
  That I can't get through.
           D
  Is there really no chance,
     E
  To start once again?
                       (Solo)     
  I'm loving you.


#Verse
F#m
Try, baby try, to trust in my love again.
          G#               C#
I will be there, I will be there.
F#m
Love, only love, just shouldn't be thrown away.
          G#               C#
I will be there, I will be there.


#Chorus
F#m       D
  If we'd go again
 A                      E
  All the way from the start.
F#m      D   
  I would try to change
 A                           E     F#m E F#m     
  The things that killed our love.

            Bm                     D
  Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know
                   F#m
  What you've been through.
             D
  You should give me a chance
       E
  This can't be the end.
