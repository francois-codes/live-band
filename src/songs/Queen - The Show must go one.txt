The Show must go on
Queen
Bm
rock pop english 90s

#Verse 1
      Bm
Empty spaces - what are we living for
          G
abandoned places - I guess we know the score
Em              F#                       Em
on and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
        Bm
Another hero, another mindless crime
           G
behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Em                  F#                      Em
hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

#Chorus
                 Bm                   G
The show must go on, the show must go on, yeah,
   Em
inside my heart is breaking
   F#
my make-up may be flaking
       Em                     Bm
but my smile still stays on.

#Verse 2
         C#m
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
        A
another heartache, another failed romance
F#m             G#                       F#m
on and on, does anybody know what we are living for?

            C#m
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now,
             A
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
F#m
outside the dawn is breaking
    G#                                  F#m    Em
but inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.

#Chorus
                 Bm                   G
The show must go on, the show must go on, yeah,
   Em
inside my heart is breaking
   F#
my make-up may be flaking
       Em                     Bm
but my smile still stays on.

#Bridge
   F       G                Em               Am G
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
F             G              Em              Am
fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
C#m7b5           D
I can fly - my friends.

#Chorus
                 Bm                   G
The show must go on, the show must go on, yeah,
     Em
I'll face it with a grin
    F#
I'm never giving in
              Em     Bm
on - with the show.

#Solo
Bm   G   Em   F#   Em


#Outro
     Em                 
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill,
  F#M                            Em
I have to find the will to carry on.
        C#m7b5            Bm
with the show, with the shoooooow
        Bm
Show must go on (go on, go on, go on)
