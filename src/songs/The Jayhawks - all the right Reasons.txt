#Intro
F#

#Verse (acoustic guitar)
     F#                       D#m
As I lay up on my bed I began dreaming,
            G#m                     E    C#7
How it's gonna be the day that I am free,
       F#                              D#m
Once I settled like the dust up on the table,  
             G#m                       E                C#7
But then you came along, you helped me write this song,

#Chorus (acoustic guitar)
B                              F#
I don't know what day it is, I can't recall the season,  
  G#m            B               F#
I don't remember how we got this far,  
B                               F#
All I know's I'm loving you for all the right reasons,
   G#m                    B             F#    C#7
My sky you'll always will be my morning star,

#Verse (tutti)
       F#                                D#m
Like a tired bird flying high across the ocean,
             G#m                      E          C#7
I was outside looking in, you made me live again,
         F#                               D#m
From the mountains to the prairies little babies,
        G#m                         E             C#7
Figures filled their heads, visions bathed in red,

#Chorus
B                              F#
I don't know what day it is, I can't recall the season,  
  G#m            B               F#
I don't remember how we got this far,  
B                               F#
All I know's I'm loving you for all the right reasons,
   G#m                    B             F#    C#7
My sky you'll always will be my morning star,

#Break
C#7   | B    | C#7   | B    | C#7   | C#7    |

#Verse
         F#                   D#m
From the train in Manchester, England,
          G#m                             E        C#7
Lightning fills the sky, as I watched you wave goodbye,
         F#                                 D#m
From the mountains to the prairies little babies,
        G#m                         E             C#7
Figures filled their heads, visions bathed in red,

#Chorus
B                              F#
I don't know what day it is, I can't recall the season,  
  G#m            B               F#
I don't remember how we got this far,  
B                               F#
All I know's I'm loving you for all the right reasons,
   G#m                    B             F#    C#7
My sky you'll always will be my morning star,
