#Chorus
 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  singing my life with his words.
 Em                      A                       D        C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.


#Verse
Am7        D
I heard he sang the good song.
G          C
I heard he had a style.
Am7        D
And so I came to see him,
    Em
and listen for a while.
Am7          D7
And there he was a young boy
G          B7
a stranger to my eyes.


#Chorus
 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  singing my life with his words.
 Em                      A                       D        C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.


#Verse
Am7        D
I felt all flushed with fever
G          C
embarrassed by the crowd.
Am7        D
I felt he found my letters
    Em
and read each one out loud.
Am7          D7
I prayed that he would finish
G          B7
but he just kept right on.


#Chorus
 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  singing my life with his words.
 Em                      A                       D        C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.


#Verse
Am7        D
He sang as if he knew me
G          C
in all my dark despair.
Am7        D
And then he looked right through me
    Em
as if I wasn't there.
Am7          D7
And he just kept on singing
G          B7
singing clear and strong


#Chorus
 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  singing my life with his words.
 Em                      A                       D        C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.
