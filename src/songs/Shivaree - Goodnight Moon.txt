#Verse 1
                      Am
There's a nail in the door
                         G
And there's glass on the lawn
             Dm
Tacks on the floor
              Am
And the TV is on
      C                 Dm
And I always sleep with my guns
            E E7
When you're gone


#Verse 2
                       Am
There's a blade by the bed
                  G
And a phone in my hand
             Dm
A dog on the floor
                     Am
And some cash on the nightstand
         C                      Dm
When I'm all alone the dreaming stops
                 E7
And I just can't stand


#Chorus
              Dm
What should I do, I'm just a little baby
            Am
What if the lights go out and maybe
             Dm
And then the wind just starts to moan
            B7                   E7
Outside the door he followed me home
                Dm
Well, goodnight moon, I want the sun
                 Am
If it's not here soon I might be done
                                E7
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
          Am
Goodnight moon


#Verse 3
                       Am
There's a shark in the pool
                   G
And a witch in the tree
            Dm
A crazy old neighbour
              Am
and he's been watching me
            C                  Dm
And there's footsteps loud and strong
                E E7
coming down the hall
                      Am
Something's under the bed
                    G
Now it's out in the hedge
                    Dm
There's a big black crow
              Am
sitting on my window ledge
    C                Dm
And I hear something scratching
             E7
through the wall


#Chorus
                  Dm
Oh, what should I do, I'm just a little baby
            Am
What if the lights go out and maybe
       Dm
I just hate to be all alone
            B7                  E7
Outside the door he followed me home
               Dm
Now goodnight moon, I want the sun
                 Am
If it's not here soon I might be done
                                E7
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
          Am
Goodnight moon

#Verse 4
                   Am
Well, you're up so high
            G
How can you save me
                    Dm
When the dark comes here
           Am
Tonight to take me up
            C             Dm
To my front walk and into bed
                   E7
Where it kisses my face and eats my head


#Chorus
                  Dm
Oh, what should I do, I'm just a little baby
            Am
What if the lights go out and maybe
             Dm
And then the wind just starts to moan
            B7                  E7
Outside the door he followed me home
               Dm
Now goodnight moon, I want the sun
                 Am
If it's not here soon I might be done
                                   E7
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
          Am
Goodnight moon
                                   E7
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
          Am
Goodnight moon
