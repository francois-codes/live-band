#Verse 1
Cm          Ab/C              Bb/C                     Cm
 Risin' up, back on the street, did my time, took my chances

 So many times, it happens too fast, you change your passion for glory

It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight

Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
         Fm                             Cm          Bb
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night

And he's watchin' us all in the eye, of the tiger

 They stack the odds 'til we take to the street, for we kill with the skill to survive

And he's watchin' us all in the eye, of the tiger
