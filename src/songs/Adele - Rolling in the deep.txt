|Â C5            |   G5
There's a fire starting in my heart,
|  Bb5                          |   G5                  Bb5
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
| C5               G5
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
    Bb5                           G5                 Bb5
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.

C5                     G5
See how I leave, with every piece of you
      Bb5                      G5             Bb5
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
C5                 G5
There's a fire starting in my heart,
  Bb5                               G5                   Bb5
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

<Ab           Bb                  Gm
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
             Ab
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             Bb                        Gm
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
              G
I can't help feeling...

We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
                Ab
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
      Bb                                Cm           Bb
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... inside of your hand (never had met me)
           Ab                                                                   Bb
And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... to the beat (rolling in the deep)

C5                 G5
Baby I have no story to be told,
         Bb5                            G5                  Bb5
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
C5                        G5
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
  Bb5                        G5                       Bb5
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

<Ab           Bb                  Gm
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
             Ab
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
