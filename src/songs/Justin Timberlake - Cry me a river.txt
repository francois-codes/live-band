#Verse 1
G#m          D#
You were my sun
E            C#m
You were my earth
G#m             D#                 E            C#m
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
G#m             D#
So you took a chance
E               C#m
And made other plans
G#m                   D#                          E              C#m
But I bet you didn't think your thing would come crashing down, no

G#m                 D#
(You don't have to say, what you did,)
  E              C#m
(I already know, I found out from him) (yeah)
 G#m                             D#                   E
(Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be)
    C#m                     G#m
And don't it make you sad about it


#Chorus
                D#
You told me you loved me
            E               C#m
Why did you leave me, all alone
G#m                  D#
Now you tell me you need me
         E                 C#m
When you call me, on the phone

G#m         D#                     E
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
                 C#m
With some other guy
G#m                  D#                     E
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn

    C#m           G#m     D#
To cry, cry me a river
          E        C#m
Cry me a river-er

Cry me a river
          E        C#m
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

#Verse 2
G#m                  D#
    I know that they say
                    E             C#m
That somethings are better left unsaid
G#m         D#            E                     C#m    NC
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it (Don't act like you don't know it)

G#m          D#
All of these things people told me
     E               C#m
Keep messing with my head (Messing with my head)
G#m                  D#
You should've picked honesty
     E                    C#m
Then you may not have blown it (yeaaaaaah)
