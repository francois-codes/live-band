#intro
E       F#m       E       F#m

#Verse
F#m                                       A
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
    E                                          F#m
You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
F#m                                          A
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
E                                                F#m
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

#chorus
Dmaj7                          Amaj7
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
     Dmaj7                              Amaj7
And, you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
Dmaj7                        C#m
   And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
Bm                           E
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

#Verse 2
        F#m                                                A
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but its sinking
    E                                   F#m
And racing around to come up behind you again
    F#m                                             A
The sun is the same in the relative way, but youre older
E                                       F#m
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

#chorus
Dmaj7                          Amaj7
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Dmaj7                               Amaj7
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Dmaj7                     C#m
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way
    Bm                              Bm7-5                F
The time is gone, the song is over, thought Id something more to say

#Verse 2
Em           A
  Home, home again
Em                         A
  I like to be here when I can
Em(add9)                        A
And when I come home cold and tired
    Em                               A
Its good to warm my bones beside the fire

#chorus
Cmaj7
Far away across the field
    Bm
The tolling of the iron bell
F
Calls the faithful to their knees
   G7              F     A5-/Eb     Bm
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.
