#verse 1
C#m7                           G#7
 What will you do when you get lonely?
C#m7   C       D       E    E7
No one waiting by your side
F#m         B           E               A
You've been runnin' and hiding much too long
F#m           B                 E
You know it's just your foolish pride

I tried to give you consolation
C#m7     C      D       E    E7
Your old man he let you down
F#m    B       E                 A
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
F#m           B                  E
You turned my whole world upside down

C#m7                    G#7

Before I finally go insane
F#m          B         E            A
Please don't say we'll never find a way
