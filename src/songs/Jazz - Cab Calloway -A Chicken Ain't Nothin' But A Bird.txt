       D                         | Em7   A7   |
(Say!) Everyone's talking 'bout chicken;
D                  | Em7   A7   |
Chicken's a popular word;
  | D             C7        | B7      Bb7   |
But anywhere you go, you're bound to find
   A7                       | D          |
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird

 D                   | Em7   A7   |
Some people call it a fowl (That's all)
D                  | Em7   A7   |
That's the story I heard (oh Brother)
   | D               C7     | B7             Bb7   |
But let 'em call it this and let 'em call it that
   A7                       | D          |
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird

#B
| G              | Gm            |
You can boil it, roast it, broil it (oooh)
D                   | D          |
Cook it in a pan or a pot (ooh
| E7                  | E7         
Eat it with potatoes, rice or tomatoes (aaah)
| A7               | A7           (NC)    |
But chicken's still what you got, boy!

#A
D                      | Em7   A7   |
  It was a dish for old Caesar
D                  | Em7   A7   |
Also King Henry the Third
        D         C7             | B7        Bb7   |
But Columbus was smart, said "You can't fool me
   A7                       | D          |
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird."
