I close my eyes,  only for a moment, and the moments gone

All my dreams    pass before my eyes, a curiosity

All They are is dust in the wind

C    G/B  Am      G              Dm         Am
Same old song,   just a drop of water in an endless sea.
C    G/B  Am    G               Dm                Am
All we   do   crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see.

All we are is dust in the wind

Don't  hang  on.

Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky.

It slips away.
G               Dm            Am
All your money won't another minute buy.#chorus
