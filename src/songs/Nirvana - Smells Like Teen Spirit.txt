<E5    A5       G5      C5
Load up  on guns  and bring your friends
<E5     A5      G5      C5
It's fun to lose  and to  pretend
<E5    A5        G5        C5

Hello,  hello,  hello!

# Refrain
             E5     A5              G5   C5
With the lights out,  it's less dangerous
           E5   A5          G5_C5
Here we are now,   entertain us
          E5_A5         G5_C5
I feel stupid  and contagious
           E5    A5      G5    C5
Here we are  now,  entertain us
     E5    A5       G5_C5
A mulatto,   an albino
      E5   A5      G5_C5    E_F
A mosquito,  my libido, yay!

And for  this gift  I feel blessed

Our little group has always been
<E5   A5      G5     C5
And always will until the end
