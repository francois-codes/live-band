#Verse
Em                      A7
Breathe, breathe in the air
Em                 A7
Don't be afraid to care
Em                 A7
Leave, don't leave me
Em                          A7
Look around and choose your own ground

#Chorus
Cmaj7
Long you live and high you fly
Bm7
Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
Fmaj7
all you touch and all you see
G                     D7#9  D7b9
Is all your life will ever be

#Verse
Em          A7
Run, rabbit run
Em                        A7
Dig that hole, forget the sun
Em                           A7
And when at last the work is done
Em                               A7
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

#Chorus
Cmaj7
For long you live and high you fly
Bm7
But only if you ride the tide
Fmaj7
And balanced on the biggest wave
G                   D7#9  D7b9
You race towards an early grave
