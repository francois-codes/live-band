#Verse 1
            E              B/D#         C#m
For all the times that you rain on my parade
            F#m              E        B/D#
And all the clubs you get in using my name
              E                  B/D#        C#m
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
              F#m           E           B/D#
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't

                   E           B/D#                 C#m
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   F#m       E                B/D#
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 E        B/D#             C#m
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              F#m        E                B/D#
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

#Pre-Chorus
              C#m          A              E
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            C#m     A                E
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 C#m         A               E                B
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          C#m A            B
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

#Chorus
             E        B       C#m       A
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        E                 B        E
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           E          B         C#m     A
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
E                 B        E
You should go and love yourself

#Verse 2
             E                B/D#     C#m
But when you told me that you hated my friends
         F#m              E           B/D#
The only problem was with you and not them
          E             B/D#           C#m
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             F#m            E            B/D#
And tried to make me forget where I came from

                   E           B/D#                 C#m
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   F#m       E                B/D#
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 E        B/D#             C#m
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              F#m        E                B/D#
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

#Pre-Chorus
              C#m          A              E
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            C#m     A                E
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 C#m         A               E                B
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          C#m A            B
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

#Chorus
             E        B       C#m       A
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        E                 B        E
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           E          B         C#m     A
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
E                 B        E
You should go and love yourself

#Verse 3
            E              B/D#         C#m
For all the times that you made me feel small
          F#m              E          B/D#
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
        E                B/D#         C#m
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
        F#m             E             B/D#
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

#Chorus
             E        B       C#m       A
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        E                 B        E
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           E          B         C#m     A
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
E                 B        E
You should go and love yourself

             E        B       C#m       A
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        E                 B        E
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           E          B         C#m     A
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
E                 B        E
You should go and love yourself
