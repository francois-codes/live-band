#Intro
Em7      Am7   Bm7


#verse
   Em7
I hold you, I touch you
   Am7             Bm7
In a maze can't find my way
   Em7
I think you, I drink you
   Am7             Bm7
I'm being served you on a tray
   A/C#    D/C      G/B       Bbdim7
You see girl, that's what I go through every day
   Am7                        B
Is this the way it should feel

   Em7
So pinch me, i'm dreamin'
   Am7             Bm7
But if it is don't let me know
   Em7
I'm drowning, don't save me
   Am7             Bm7
This is the way i want to go
   A/C#    D/C     G/B       Bbdim7       Am7          Bm7
You see girl, you thrill me, half kill me, that's what you do

#chorus
Em7                 Am7      D/F#
Ai no corrida, that's where I am
     Bm7       Em7       Am7
You send me there, your dream is my command
Em7               Am7      D/F#
Ai no corrida, i find myself
     Bm7      Em7       Am7
No other thought, just you and nothing else
Am7    Bm7      Em7
You and nothing else

#verse
   Em7                      Am7         Bm7
Before i first saw you each day was just another day
   Em7                      Am7         Bm7
Night the lonely interlude just came, then blew away
   A/C#     D/C     G/B       Bbdim7           Am7                 B
You know girl, everything was come what may until you fell in my life

   Em7                      Am7         Bm7
This spell that i'm under has caught me in a daze
   Em7                      Am7         Bm7
Your lightning and thunder sets my poor heart ablaze
   A/C#    D/C     G/B        Bbdim7          Am7           Bm7
You see girl, you thrill me, half kill me that's what you do

Em7               Am7      D/F#
Ai no corrida, i find myself
     Bm7      Em7       Am7
