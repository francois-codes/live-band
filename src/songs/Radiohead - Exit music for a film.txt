Bm               F#         D/A             Eadd9/G#
wake from your sleep,   the drying of your tears,
Bm             F#       Bsus4   B
today we escape,   we escape
Bm                F#       D/A                  Eadd9/G#   Eadd9/G
pack and get dressed,     before your father hears us,
Bm          F#          Bsus4   B
before all hell breaks loose

breathe,        keep breathing
Bsus2     Bm Bsus2    Bsus4      Bm          F#sus4

breathe,        keep breathing
Bsus2          Bm   Bsus2    Bsus4    Bm      F#sus4    F#

there's sucha chill, sucha chill


#Bridge

F#sus4     F#
wisdom choke you


#Outro
Bm           F#           D/A         Eadd9/G#   Eadd9/G
And now we are one, in everlasting peace,

We hope that you choke, that you choke
Bm                F#               Bsus4   B
We hope that you choke, that you choke
Bm                F#               Bsus4   B
We hope that you choke, that you choke
