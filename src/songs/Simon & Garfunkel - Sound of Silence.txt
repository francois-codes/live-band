Dm

#verse 1
Dm                        C
    Hello darkness my old friend
                           Dm
I've come to talk with you again
          F          Bb      F
Because a vision softly creeping
                       Bb       F
Left his seeds while I was sleeping
        Bb                            F
And the vision that was planted in my brain
               Dm   F            C        D
Still remain          within the sound of silence.

#verse 2
                             C
In restless dreams I walked alone
                          Dm
Narrow streets of cobbled stone
           F       Bb       F
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                          Bb       F
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        Bb                                       F
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                       Dm   F                 C        Dm
That split the night          and touched the sound of silence.

#verse 3
                         C
And in the naked light I saw
                          Dm
Ten thousand people maybe more
       F           Bb       F
People talking without speaking
                   Bb        F
People hearing without listening
               Bb                      F
People writing songs that voices never share
                  Dm   F             C        Dm
And no one dare          disturb the sound of silence

#verse 4
                        C
Fools said I you do not know
                      Dm
Silence like a cancer grow
        F            Bb          F
Hear my words that I might teach you
                   Bb          F
Take my arm that I might reach you
       Bb                          F
But my words like silent raindrops fell
Dm       F             C       Dm
     And echoed in the well of silence

#verse 5
                         C
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Dm
To the neon god they made
        F                Bb      F
And the sign flashed out its warning
                     Bb      F
In the words that it was forming
F
And the sign said
    Bb                                              F
The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
                     Dm       F                C        Dm
And tenement halls        and whispered in the sound of silence
