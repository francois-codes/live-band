Dm            Dmmaj7               Dm7
When I was a little boy I used to wonder
Dm6                Gm         Bb              F       C      A
Just how old you'd have to be...... to feel good....
Dm               Dmmaj7                     Dm7
Now I've seen a thousand girls but I still wonder
Dm6                        Gm            Bb
Cause they just don't make sense to me......
          Bdim          Esus      E
God knows I've tried...............


Am                   E             C
I've tried to be the unpredictable one
                     Dm                     Fmaj7
I've tried to be the friend that they could rely on
           G/C     G
I've still got none Got nothing at all


#Chorus
Fmaj7                  C
And so I fall into the open
G
Just singing out your name
Fmaj7                          G
And when I'm done, crashed and maimed
                                       Dm Am
I hope that's where you'll find me....................

#Verse
Dm                     Dmmaj7                 Dm7
You know that if it's up to me I'll still be holding
Dm6             Gm           Bb
My own hand the day I die........
    Bdim       Esus   E
So please release me now

Am                   E               C
I've tried to be the mean mysterious one
                     Dm                   Fmaj7
I've tried to be the sweetest candy you'd suck on
           G/C    G
I've still got none  Got nothing at all

#choruse
Fmaj7                      C
And so I fall into the open
G
Just singing out your name
Fmaj7                          G
And when I'm done, crashed and maimed
                           Fmaj7
I hope that's where you'll find me

Fmaj7                  C
And so I fall into the open
G
Just singing out your name
Fmaj7                          G
And when I'm done, crashed and maimed

           Dm           Fmaj7
And it's a good day for being found
     C                            G
Just crawling in the dirt with my head underground
           Dm           Fmaj7
And it's a good day for you to come
    G
Collecting all the pieces of the damage done

#bridge
Am                E            C
And after all the bandages are gone
                     Dm                     Fmaj7
I hope you'll find a favourite part you can work on
           G/C    G
Cause I've got none  Got nothing at all


#chorus
Fmaj7                  C
And so I fall into the open
G
Just singing out your name
Fmaj7                          G
And when I'm done, crashed and maimed
                           Fmaj7
I hope that's where you'll find me


Fmaj7                  C
And so I fall into the open
G
Just singing out your name
Fmaj7                          G               Fmaj7
And when I'm done, crashed and maimed

         C
into the open
G                     Fmaj7
Just singing out your name......
G                                                          F
Collecting all the pieces of the damage done.
