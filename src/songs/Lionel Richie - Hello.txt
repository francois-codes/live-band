#verse 1
     Am              Am7     | Fmaj7     Am7_Fmaj7 |
I've been alone with you inside my mind
     Am                Am7              | Fmaj7     Am7_Fmaj7 |
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
  Am                  Am7           | Fmaj7     Am7_Fmaj7 |
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
    Am   Am7     Fmaj7               A
Hello,       is it me you're looking for ?

       Bb            C7(aug) E          Am       A2   | Am     A2 |
You're all I've ever wanted     and my arms are open wide
            Dm                 G          |  C                  F |
'Cause you know just what to say and you know just what to do
       Bb               C7(aug)     E           | Am       Am7/G    |  Fmaj7      Am7/G_Fmaj7 |

#verse 2
  Am             Am7             | Fmaj7     Am7_Fmaj7 |
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
      Am               Am7        | Fmaj7     Am7_Fmaj7 |
And tell you time and time again, how much I care
       Am              Am7          | Fmaj7     Am7_Fmaj7 |
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

Hello,      I've just got to let you know

#chorus
    |    Dm               G       | C                F   |

    |   Bb                C7(aug)  E      |  Am      A2  |  Am     A2  |
Are you somewhere feeling lonely      or is someone loving you?
    |    Dm               G     |  C                F   |
Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue
