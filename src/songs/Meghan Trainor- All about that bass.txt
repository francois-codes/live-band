All 'bout that bass
Meghan Trainor
A
English 00s

#Chorus
                     A
Because you know I'm all about that bass,
A
'Bout that bass 'bout that bass, no treble
    Bm
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
    E
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
    A
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

#Verse
A
Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size 2
Bm
But I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do
E
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
A (NC)
All the right junk in all the right places

A
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
Bm
We know that shit ain't real
Bm
Come on now, make it stop
E
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
A                           D
'Cause every inch of you is perfect
          A
From the bottom to the top

#Pre-Chorus
A                                                 Bm
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
          E                                           A
She says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night
A                                                  Bm
You know I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll,
E
So, if that's what's you're into
         D               A
Then go ahead and move along!
