#Verse 1
C                        Cmaj7
Something in the way she moves,
C7                         F
Attracts me like no other lover.
D7                         G
Something in the way she woos me.
   Am                        Am(maj7)
I don't wanna leave her now,
     Am7                 D9       F   Eb   G  
You know I believe, and how.

#Verse 2
C                            Cmaj7
Somewhere in her smile she knows,
C7                            F      F/E
  That I don't need no other lover.
D7                           G
Something in her style that shows me.
   Am                        Am(maj7)
I don't wanna leave her now,
     Am7                 D9       F   Eb   G
You know I believe and how.

#Verse 3
A                C#m/G#          F#m7   A/E
  You're asking me will my love grow,
        D      G        A
I don't know, I don't know.
A             C#m/G#            F#m7  A/E
  You stick around now, it may show,
        D      G        C     
I don't know, I don't know.

#Verse 4
C                          Cmaj7
Something in the way she knows,

And all I have to do is think of her.
D7                             G
Something in the things she shows me.
  Am                          Am(maj7)
I don't wanna leave her now.
    Am7                 D9
You know I believe and how.
