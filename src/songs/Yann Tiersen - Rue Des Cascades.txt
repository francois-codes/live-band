| Bm    | Bm    | Bm    | D  A   |


#Verse 1 :
   | Bm                                    | Bm
For those who don't know me I can get a bit crazy,
               | Bm           | D              A
 Have to get my way 24 hours a day, cause I'm hot like that.
| Bm                                       | Bm
  Every guy everywhere just gives me mad attention,
                     | Bm                 | D              A
 Like I'm under inspection I always get to ten, cause I'm built like that.

#Pre-Chorus:
| G                             | Em/G             Gmaj7
   I go through guys like money flyin' out their hands.
| Bm                                           
   They try to change me but they realize they can't.
| G                                  | F#m7
   And every tomorrow is a day I never planned.
            | Em                  | F#
   If you're gonna be my man understand.

#Chorus:
          | Bm               | Bm   
 I can't be tamed, I can't be saved,
            | Bm      
 I can't be blamed, I can't can't.
 | D      A     | Bm                | Bm   
 I can't can't be tamed, I can't be changed,
            | Bm                        | D      A     | Bm          
 I can't be saved, I can't be (can't be), I can't be tamed.

#Verse:
| Bm                                               | Bm
  If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
               | Bm                             | D       
 I'm not here to sell ya, or tell ya to go to hell.
           A
 I'm not a brat like that.
| Bm                                       | Bm  
 I'm like a puzzle but all of my pieces are jagged,
                | Bm                             D
 If you can understand this, we can make some magic.
     A
 I'm on like that.

#Pre-Chorus:
| G                   | Em/G         Gmaj7
 I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go.
 | Bm                                           
 I wanna be a part of something I don't know.
| G                        | Em/G       F#m7
 And if you try to hold me back I might explode,
| Em                   | F#
 Baby by now you should know.

#Chorus:
         | Bm               | Bm   
I can't be tamed, I can't be saved,
           | Bm      
I can't be blamed, I can't can't.
| D      A     | Bm                | Bm   
I can't can't be tamed, I can't be changed,
           | Bm                        | D      A     | Bm          
I can't be saved, I can't be (can't be), I can't be tamed.

#Bridge :
 N.C.                           
 I'm not a trick you play, I'm wired a different way.
 N.C.
 I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, It's set in my DNA.
     | G         | G         | Bm     | Bm
 Don't change me,      Don't change me,
      | G       | G    F#m7     | Em     | F#
 Don't change me,         Don't change me, I can't be tamed.

#Pre-Chorus:
| G                   | Em/G         Gmaj7
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go.
| Bm                                           
I wanna be a part of something I don't know.
| G                        | Em/G       F#m7
And if you try to hold me back I might explode,
| Em                   | F#
Baby by now you should know.

#Chorus:
         | Bm               | Bm   
I can't be tamed, I can't be saved,
           | Bm      
I can't be blamed, I can't can't.
| D      A     | Bm                | Bm   
I can't can't be tamed, I can't be changed,
           | Bm                        | D      A     | Bm  N.C.          
I can't be saved, I can't be (can't be), I can't be tamed.
