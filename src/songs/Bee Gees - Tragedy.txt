#Verse 1
D
Here I lie,In a lost and lonely part of town
D
Held in time,In a world of tears I slowly drown
E                              F#
Goin home,I just can't take it all alone
                   E
I really should be holding you,Holding you
G
Loving you, loving you

#Chorus
Bm               F#m
Tragedy,When the feelings gone and you can't go on
    Bm               F#m
Its tragedy,When the morning cries and you don't know why
   G/A                A
Its hard to bear,With no-one to love you you're
 Bm            G  F#7
Goin nowhere
Bm               F#m
Tragedy,When you lose control and and you got no soul
    Bm               F#m
Its tragedy,When the morning cries and you don't know why
   G/A                A
Its hard to bear,With no-one beside you you're
 Bm            G  F#7
Goin nowhere

#Verse 2
D
Night and day,There's a burning down inside of me
D
Burning love,With a yearning that wont let me be
E                                  F#
Down I go,And I just can't take it all alone
                   E
I really should be holding you,Holding you
G
Loving you loving you

#Chorus
Bm               F#m

Goin nowhere
Bm               F#m
Tragedy,When you lose control and and you got no soul
    Bm               F#m
Its tragedy,When the morning cries and you don't know why
   G/A                A
