 (lick)              (lick)

#Verse 1
G      G7/F Am7 D13     | G   G7/F | Am7 D13 |
Heaven,          I'm in heaven
       G           Am7     G/B   G/C    Cmmaj7
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
Bm7 E7    Am7              D9         | Bm7-5 | E7 |
    And I seem to find the happiness I seek
           Am7          D9               | G G7/F | Am7 D13 |
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

#Verse 2
G      G7/F Am7 D13     | G   G7/F | Am7 D13 |
Heaven,          I'm in heaven
        G          Am7   G/B      G/C         Cmmaj7
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Bm7 E7      Am7           D9             | Bm7-5 | E7 |
    Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
           Am7          D9               | G | % |
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

#Bridge
      Am7     D7      G
Oh, I love to climb a mountain
    Am7       D7      G
And reach the highest peak
       Am7     D7        G       Em7
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
   Am7     D7       G
As dancing cheek to cheek

        Am7     D7     G
Oh, Iâ€™d love to go out fishing
     Am7   D7   G
In a river or a creek
      Am7     D7     G       Em7
But I don't enjoy it half as much
   Am7     D7       G
As dancing cheek to cheek

#Middle 8
           Gm7

Will carry me through to ...
