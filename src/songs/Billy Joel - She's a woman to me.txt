#Verse 1
        A           D              A              D
She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes.
                  G              Gmaj7  G   Gmaj7
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies.
        A7     D              A            F#
And she only reveals what she wants you to see.
    Bm           Bm/A              G        A7       D  Dsus
She hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me.

#Verse 2
        A           D             A           D
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you.
        D           G                 Gmaj7     G      G6  G
She can ask for the truth, but she'll never believe you
           A7            D           A7           F#
And she'll take what you give her as long it's free
    Bm            Bm/A             G6       A7       D D/C#
She steals like a thief, but she's always a woman to me.

#Chorus
Bm Bm/A E7        E7         A A/G# F#m
Ohhh... she takes care of herself.
        D           G G/F# Em       A7          D  G D
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time.
Dm Dm/C Bm         G           C C/B     Am
Ohhh  ...  and she never gives out,
        F6          Bb Bb/A G#dim7   E7          A   A6 A7
and she never gives in,     she just changes her mind.

#Verse 3
           A7          D             A         D
And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden
            D7         G           Gmaj7              G6       G
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
        A7             D            A7           F#
But she brings out the best and the worst you can be.
         Bm         Bm/A              G6       A7       D
Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a women to me.

#Chorus
Bm Bm/A E7        E7         A A/G# F#m
Ohhh... she takes care of herself.
        D           G G/F# Em       A7          D  G D
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time.
Dm Dm/C Bm         G           C C/B     Am
Ohhh  ...  and she never gives out,
        F6          Bb Bb/A G#dim7   E7          A   A6 A7
and she never gives in,     she just changes her mind.

#Verse 4
      A7         D              A        D
She's frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
        D7        G              Gmaj7     G
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool
        A7       D                A7           F#
But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree
        Bm            Bm/A        G          D              Em       A7       D Dsus D
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you, but she's always a woman to me
