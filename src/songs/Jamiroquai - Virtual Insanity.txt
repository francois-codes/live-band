#Intro
Ebm7 Ab7sus4 Dbmaj9   Gbmaj11
     Ooh,    He - ey, oh
Cm7b5                Bmaj7               Bb7#5
What we're living in,     let me tell ya


#Verse 1
       Ebm7           Ab7sus4
It's a wonder man can eat at all
     Dbmaj9              Gbmaj11
When things are big that should be small
Cm7b5             Bmaj7
Who can tell what magic spells
Bb7#5          Ebm7
Will be doing for us?

        Ebm7          Ab7sus4
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Dbmaj9     Gbmaj11
   Only to be told
Cm7b5         Bmaj7
I can't see, I can't breathe,
Bb7#5            Ebm7 – Gbmaj11
no more will we be

    Ab7sus4                       Dbmaj9
And nothing's going to change the way we live
     Gbmaj11                Cm7b5
Cos' we can always take but never give
  Bmaj7                         Bb7#5
An' now that things're changing for the worse, see

Ebm7
    Woah,
Ab7sus4               Dbmaj9
     It's a crazy world we're living in
Gbmaj11               Cm7b5
     And I just can't see that
        Bmaj7           Bb7#5         Bb7  -  Dm7b5
Half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these


#Chorus 1
  Bmaj7   Ddim7    Ebm7 - Gbmaj11  Abm7 - Bb7
  Futures made of virtu - al    insani  - ty now
  Bmaj7  Ddim7       Ebm7 - Gbmaj11  Abm7 -  Bb7
  Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
  Bmaj7    Ddim7    Ebm7 - Gbmaj11 Abm7 - Bb7
  Useless, twisting of the new techno - logy
      Bmaj7           Ddim7         Ebm7  -  Gbmaj11 Abm7 – Bb7
  Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under - ground


#Verse 2
         Ebm7           Ab7sus4
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Dbmaj9             Gbmaj11
Hard to know where to begin
   Cm7b5            Bmaj7
If I could slip the sickly ties
     Bb7#5  -  Dm7b5   Ebm7 – Gbmaj11
That earthly   man has made
    Ab7sus4   Dbmaj9 Gbmaj11           Cm7b5
And now every mother can choose the colour
Bmaj7             Bb7#5    –    Dm7b5    Ebm7 - Gbmaj11
     Of her child,   that's not nature's way

      Ab7sus4                    Dbmaj9
Well that's what they said yesterday
        Gbmaj11                Cm7b5
There's nothing left to do but pray
  Bmaj7                   Bb7#5 - Dm7b5  Ebm7 –  Gbmaj11
I think it's time I found a new  eligion,  wo  - ah,
     Ab7sus4      Dbmaj9        Gbmaj11
it's so insane to synthesize another strain
        Cm7b5              Bmaj7           Bb7#5  –  Dm7b5
There's something in these futures that we have  to be told


#Chorus 2
  Bmaj7   Ddim7    Ebm7 - Gbmaj11  Abm7 - Bb7
  Futures made of virtu - al    insani  - ty now
  Bmaj7  Ddim7       Ebm7 - Gbmaj11  Abm7 -  Bb7
  Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
  Bmaj7    Ddim7    Ebm7 - Gbmaj11 Abm7 - Bb7
  Useless, twisting of the new techno - logy
      Bmaj7           Ddim7         Ebm7  -  Gbmaj11 Abm7 – Bb7
  Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under - ground


#Chorus 3
  Bmaj7                Ddim7      Ebm7  -  Gbmaj11 Abm7 - Bb7
  Now there is no sound     if we all live under-ground
  Bmaj7                      Ddim7
      And now it's virtual insanity
     Ebm7 -   Gbmaj11   Abm7 - Bb7
  Forget your virtual real -  ity
  Bmaj7                    Ddim7    Ebm7 - Gbmaj11  Abm7 - Bb7
       Oh, there's nothing so bad.       I know   ye - ah


#Interlude

Ebm7  Ab7sus4  Dbmaj9  Gbmaj11  Cm7b5  Bmaj7  Bb7#5


#Chorus 4
  Bmaj7   Ddim7    Ebm7 - Gbmaj11  Abm7 - Bb7
  Futures made of virtu - al    insani  - ty now
  Bmaj7  Ddim7       Ebm7 - Gbmaj11  Abm7 -  Bb7
  Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
  Bmaj7    Ddim7    Ebm7 - Gbmaj11 Abm7 - Bb7
  Useless, twisting of the new techno - logy
      Bmaj7           Ddim7         Ebm7  -  Gbmaj11 Abm7 – Bb7
  Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under - ground


#Chorus 5
  Bmaj7      Ddim7 Ebm7 -  Gbmaj11 Abm7 - Bb7
      (Living),    virtu - al    insani – ty
  Bmaj7      Ddim7 Ebm7 -  Gbmaj11 Abm7 - Bb7
      (Living),    virtu - al    insani – ty
  Bmaj7      Ddim7 Ebm7 -  Gbmaj11 Abm7 - Bb7
      (Living),    virtu - al    insani – ty
  Bmaj7      Ddim7 Ebm7 -  Gbmaj11 Abm7 - Bb7
      (Living),    virtu - al    insani – ty


#Outro
