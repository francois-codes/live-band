#Verse 1
   Am7                       Dm7
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
              G7                             Cmaj7
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
           Fmaj7                         Bm7b5
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
           Esus4             E
And I grew strong, I learned how to get along

              Am7             Dm7
And so you're back from outer space
              G              G7                 Cmaj7
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
              Fmaj7                                Bm7b5
I should have changed that stupid lock I should have made you leave your key
         Esus4                              E
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me


#Chorus
          Am7             Dm7
Go on now go, walk out the door
          G         G7                 Cmaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Fmaj7                            Bm7b5
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
              Esus4                      E
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die

           Am7          Dm7
Oh no, not I, I will survive
   G              G7             Cmaj7
As long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
         Fmaj7                         Bm7b5
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
            Esus4           E          Am7
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

#Verse 2
        Am7                           Dm7
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
            G                G7           Cmaj7
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
            Fmaj7                          Bm7b5
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
          Esus4           E
I used to cry,  but now I hold my head up high

            Am7         Dm7
And you see me somebody new
             G                 G7              Cmaj7
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
           Fmaj7                            Bm7b5
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
        Esus4                        E
Now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me


#Chorus
          Am7             Dm7
Go on now go walk out the door
          G         G7                 Cmaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Fmaj7                            Bm7b5
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
              Esus4                      E
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

           Am7          Dm7
Oh no, not I, I will survive
   G              G7                 Cmaj7
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
         Fmaj7                         Bm7b5
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
            Esus4           E
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh .....


#Chorus
          Am7             Dm7
Go on now go walk out the door
          G         G7                 Cmaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Fmaj7                            Bm7b5
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
              Esus4                      E
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

           Am7          Dm7
Oh no, not I, I will survive
   G              G7                 Cmaj7
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
         Fmaj7                         Bm7b5
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
            Esus4           E             Am7
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive
