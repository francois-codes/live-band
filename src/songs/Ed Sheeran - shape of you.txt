    C#m                      F#m
The club isn't the best place    to find a lover
       A                 B
So the bar is where I go
C#m                      F#m
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
         A                         B
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
     C#m                       F#m
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
    A                       B
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        C#m                     F#m
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
    A                     B
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


C#m              F#m
Girl, you know I want your love
A                      B                 C#m
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
             F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
A               B
I may be crazy, don't mind me
     C#m            F#m
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
A                    B                C#m
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
             F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
      A                      NC
Come, come on now, follow my lead

#Refrain
<C#m   F#m                    A
I'm in love with the shape of you
            B                  C#m
We push and pull like a magnet do
            F#m              A
Although my heart is falling too
       B                   C#m
I'm in love with your body
         F#m                  A
And last night you were in my room
           B                    C#m
And now my bedsheets smell like you
                 F#m                  A
Every day discovering something brand new
       B                   C#m
I'm in love with your body


C#m       F#m
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I

One week in we let the story begin
            A                    B
We're going out on our first date
        C#m                   A
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
             B                   NC
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            C#m                       F#m
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
             A                   B
And how your family is doing okay
          C#m                 F#m
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
         A                         B
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like


C#m              F#m
Girl, you know I want your love
A                      B                 C#m
