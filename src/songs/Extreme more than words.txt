#Verse 1
F#          Badd9
Saying I love you is
G#m7             B       C#         F#
not the words I want to hear from you
F#                Badd9
It's not that I want you
G#m7            B      C#    D#m
not to say but if you only knew

         G#m7
Ho-ow ea-sy
C#              F#      C#/F     D#m
It would be to show me how you feel
          G#m7      C#7              F#7
More than words is all you have to do
F#7         B
To make it real

B         Bm              F#
Then you wouldn't have to say
          D#m7
That you love me 'cos
G#m7    C#7   F#
I'd already know


#Chorus
F#              C#/F   D#m          A#m      B
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
B                    F#/A#    G#m7            C#7              F#
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
F#              C#/F     D#m7        A#m     B
What would you say if I took those words away?
B                     F#/A#      G#m7
Then you couldn't make things new
         C#7           F#
Just by saying I love you


#Interlude

| F#  F#/A# | Badd9    | G#m7    | B  C# |


#Verse 2
F#             Badd9
Now that I've tried to
G#m7             B        C#     F#
Talk to you and make you understand
F#            Badd9
All that you have to do is
G#m7            B               C#          D#m
Close your eyes and just reach out your hands
          G#m7
          
And touch me
C#                   F#    C#/F   D#m
Hold me close don't ever let me go
          G#m7
More than words
C#7           F#7                 B
Is all I ever needed you to show
B        Bm                   F#
Then you wouldn't have to say
          D#m7
That you love me 'cos
G#m7   C#7    F#
I'd already know


#Chorus
F#              C#/F     D#m        A#m      B
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
B                   F#/A#     G#m7             C#7                F#
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
F#              C#/F     D#m7        A#m     B
What would you say if I took those words away?
B                     F#/A#      G#m7
Then you couldn't make things new
        C#7            F#
Just by saying I love you
