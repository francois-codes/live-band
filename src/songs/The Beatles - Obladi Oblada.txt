Molly is the singer in a band
A                               D
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
          A                E                A
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand


#Chorus
      A                       E   F#m
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
A            E         A
Lala how the life goes on
      A                       E   F#m
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
A            E        A
Lala how the life goes on.


#Verse 2
A                              E
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweller's store
E7                         A
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
A                              D
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
          A               E             A
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
A            E         A
Lala how the life goes on

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!

Lala how the life goes on.

  In a couple of years,
                             | A Asus2 | A A7 |
They have built a home sweet home,
D
  With a couple of kids running in the yard,
   A/E               E
Of Desmond and Molly Jones... (Ha ha ha ha ha)


#Verse 3
A                       E
Happy ever after in the market place
E7                               A
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
A                                D
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
           A                 E                 A
And in the evening she still sings it with the band


#Chorus
      A                       E   F#m
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
A            E         A
Lala how the life goes on
      A                       E   F#m
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
A            E         A
Lala how the life goes on.
