#Verse 1
Dm             C            F       C
   I'm walking out of love
Dm             C          F               C
   I'm walking bad really down     Like a cool breeze
Dm           C        F               C           Dm
   I'm gonna be late again     Driver wait for me please
            C              F                         C
I'm drivin' all in vain    Tryin' catch this fuckin' train

Dm   C   F   C

Dm           C          F        C
  Time don't fool me no more
Dm           C            F                C
  I throw my watch to the floor    was so lazy
Dm         C      F                C            Dm
Time don't do it again     Now I'm stressed and strained
     C         F               C      Dm
With anger and pain     In the subway train


#Refrain
         C         F            C               Dm
Now it's half past two     Long gone the rendez vous
         C         F                     C           Dm
Now it's half past three     Time made a fool out of me
         C         F           C              Dm
Now it's half past four     Oh baby can't you see
          C          F                      A
No use in waiting no more     It's a timing tragedy
  A7                       A7
I think it's nine     When clock says ten
     A7                                                          Dm
This girls wouldn't wait     For the out of time     Out of time man
