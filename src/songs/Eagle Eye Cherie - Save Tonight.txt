Am      F       C        G           x4


#Verse 1
          Am    F    C       G
Go on and close  the curtains
              Am  F    C     G
'Cause all we need is candlelight
        Am  F     C             G
You and me, and a bottle of wine
        Am        F  C   G
To hold you tonight (oh)

        Am  F     C      G
Well we know, I'm going away
          Am  F      C          G
And how I wish - I wish it weren't so
             Am  F    C          G
So take this wine and drink with me
    Am              F      C G
And let's delay our misery

#Chorus
     Am     F     C                 G
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
      Am      F      C           G
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
     Am     F     C                 G
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
        Am  F       C             G
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

#Verse 2
          Am  F      C    G
There's a log on the fire
       Am   F      C       G
And it burns like  me for you
         Am  F       C    G
Tomorrow comes with one desire
   Am      F   C    G
To take me away (ohh it's true)

         Am  F  C       G
It ain't easy to say good-bye
        Am      F     C          G
Darlin' please, don't start to cry
       Am                 F    C    G
'Cause girl you know I've got to go (oh)
    Am             F   C    G
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

#Chorus
     Am     F     C                 G
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
        Am      F      C           G
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
     Am     F     C                 G
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
        Am  F       C             G
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

I wish that I, that I could stay
    Am                 F   C  G
