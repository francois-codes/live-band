Am       D7       G
La la la la la la la

#verse 1
Am            D7                 G
Now that I've lost everything to you
            Cmaj7                 F
You say you wanna start something new
         Dm                       E
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'
%
Baby, I'm grievin'

Am               D7               G
But if you wanna leave, take good care
                Cmaj7                 F
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
           Dm                      E       G7
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

#chorus
C   G                  F
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
G                F              C
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
C   G                  F
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
G             F                 C         Dm_E
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

#verse 2
Am                   D7                        G
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
         Cmaj7                F
And it's breakin' my heart in two
          Dm                    E
Because I never wanna see you a sad, girl

Don't be a bad girl

Am               D7               G
But if you wanna leave, take good care
                Cmaj7                   F
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
           Dm                           E     G7
But just remember there's a lot of bad, and beware

#chorus

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
G                F              C
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
C   G                  F
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
G             F                 C         Dm_E
I'll always remember you like a child, girl
