#Intro

#Verse
F#m
  She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                                                     Bm
  I said don't mind but what do you mean,I am the one
                                        F#m
  Who will dance on the floor in the round
                     Bm
  She said I am the one
                                          F#m
  Who will dance on the floor in the round?

             F#m
  She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.
             F#m
  Then ev'ry head turned with eyes that dreamed
                 Bm
  Of being the one,
                                        F#m
  Who will dance on the floor in the round

#Pre-Chorus
  D                           F#m
  People always told me, be careful what you do.
  D                                             F#m
  And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
     D                          F#m
  And mother always told me, be careful who you love,
          D                              C#(7)
  And be careful what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth, hey

#Chorus
F#m
  Billie Jean is not my lover,
                                               Bm
  She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
                          F#m
  But the kid is not my son
                      Bm
  She says I am the one,
                         F#m
  But the kid is not my son

#Verse
F#m
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
                                                     Bm
But who can stand when she's in demand,
                                        F#m
Her scemes and plans
                     Bm
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round.
                                          F#m
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice

      F#m
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me,
      F#m
Then showed a photo. My baby cried.
                 Bm
His eyes were like mine.
                                        F#m
Can we dance on the floor in the round?

#Pre-Chorus
  D                           F#m
  People always told me, be careful what you do.
  D                                             F#m
  And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
     D                          F#m
  And mother always told me, be careful who you love,
          D                              C#(7)
  And be careful what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth, hey

#Chorus
F#m
  Billie Jean is not my lover,
                                               Bm
  She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
                          F#m
  But the kid is not my son
                      Bm
  She says I am the one,
                         F#m
  But the kid is not my son
