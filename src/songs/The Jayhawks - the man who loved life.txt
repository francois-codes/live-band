#Intro
|  Em   | G    | A7   | Cmaj7   |

#Verse 1
Em
Won't you take my hand
G
Won't you be my friend
A7                 Cmaj7
Take my advice, go away
Em                               G
When the days get short and the chips are down
A7                          Cmaj7
Will you be there, will you stick around
|  Em   | G    | A7   | Cmaj7   |
...

#Verse 2
Em
And if thou shalt give
G
Thou shalt be deceived
A7                          Cmaj7
This traveling band was not well received
Em              G
No open arms or reception lines
A7                      Cmaj7
Just handlebars wearing five point stars

#Chorus
E                   B
Am I living in your dream
G                          | C   G   |
We got the guns, we got the guns
G                              |  Asus2  B   |
A thousand to one, a thousand to one
    | Em            G     |
He's the man, he's the man
         C
He's the man who loved life

<F
Served by different stories (ooh lala)
                    C
Am I living in your dreams (ooh lala aaaaah)
F
Pretty metal green (ooh lala)
                     C        Em
Can I ride upon your wings so free (aaaaaah)

#Verse 4
Em                            G
In the canyon walls there's a trusty lot
A7
The stakes were high
Cmaj7
The sun was hot
Em                      G
You can rest assured as casinos rise
     A7                      Cmaj7
Buzz around my ears like the dragonflies

#Chorus
E                   B
Am I living in your dream
G                          | C   G   |
We got the guns, we got the guns
G                              |  Asus2  B   |
A thousand to one, a thousand to one
    | Em            G     |
He's the man, he's the man
         C            | Cm     NC |
He's the man who loved life

F
Served from different shores (ooh lala)
                    C
Am I living in your dream (aaaaah)
F
Pretty metal green (ooh lala)
Am                    C         Em
 I living in your dream, so real
