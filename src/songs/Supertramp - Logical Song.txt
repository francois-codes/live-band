#Verse 1
Cm                               Abmaj7      Gm7
When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,
   Bb                 Fm7/Ab     F7/A
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.
            Cm                                 Abmaj7     Gm7
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,
  Bb        Fm7/Ab  Am7-5
Joyfully, playfully watching me.

              Cm                       Abmaj7    Gm7
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible,
  Bb        Fm7/Ab    F7/A
Logical, responsible, practical.
          Cm                             Abmaj7    Gm7
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,
  Bb       Fm7/Ab       Am7-5
Clinical, intellectual, cynical.


#Chorus
           Eb                        Am7-5/Eb
There are times when all the world's asleep,
                      Abmaj7  
The questions run too deep
                  Db Dbmaj7/C Bbm7 Bbm7/Ab
For such a simple man.

           Eb                               Am7-5/Eb
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
                 Abmaj7  
I know it sounds absurd
                         Db Dbmaj7/C Bbm7 Bbm7/Ab
But please tell me who I am.


#Verse 2
     Cm                               Abmaj7       Gm7
Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,
  Bb        Fm7/Ab    F7/A
Liberal, fanatical, criminal.
           Cm                             Abmaj7       Gm7
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable
  Bb        Fm7/Ab          F7/A
Respectable, presentable, a vegetable!

#Chorus]

   Eb                        Am7-5/Eb
At night, when all the world's asleep,
                      Abmaj7  
The questions run so deep
                  Db Dbmaj7/C Bbm7 Bbm7/Ab
For such a simple man.

           Eb                               Am7-5/Eb
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
                 Abmaj7  
I know it sounds absurd
                         Db Dbmaj7/C Bbm7 Bbm7/Ab
But please tell me who I am.


      Db Dbmaj7/C Bbm7 Bbm7/Ab
Who I am.
      Db Dbmaj7/C Bbm7 Bbm7/Ab
Who I am.
      Db Dbmaj7/C Bbm7 Bbm7/Ab
Who I am.
