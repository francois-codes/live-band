Gm7                  C7
Sitting in my kitchen, hey girl
    Gm7                      C7
I'm turning into dust again
   Gm7              C7
My melancholy baby
                  Gm7
The star of mazzy must
                 C7
Push her voice inside of me

    Gm7               C7
I'm overcoming gravity
    Gm7               C7
I'm overcoming gravity

Just one note

The song she wrote

Could fuck me where I lay
