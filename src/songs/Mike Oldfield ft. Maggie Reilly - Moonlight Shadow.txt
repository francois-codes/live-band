#Intro
| E       | B       | C#m    A    | B       |


#Verse 1
  | C#m               | A
The last that ever she saw him
| B              | E         B
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
  | C#m                 | A
He passed on worried and warning
| B              | E         B
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.

| E                 | B
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
| C#m  A      |  B
Far away on the other side.
    | E                       | B
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
      | C#m           A         | B
And she couldn't find how to push through


#Verse 2
  | C#m                     | A
The trees that whisper in the evening
| B             | E         B
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
     | C#m              | A
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
| B              | E         B
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

| E              | B
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
| C#m  A        | B
Far away on the other side.
     | E                 | B
He was shot six times by a man on the run
       | C#m           A         | B
And she couldn't find how to push through



#Bridge
| B     | B
  I stay   I pray
  |  E     A    | B
See you in heaven far away
| B     | B
  I stay   I pray
  | E      A     | B
See you in heaven   one day


#Verse 3
| C#m         | A
Four am in the morning
| B             | E         B
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
| C#m               | A
I watched your vision forming
| B             | E         B
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

| E               | B
Star was light in a silvery night
| C#m  A      | B
Far away on the other side
      | E               | B
Will you come to talk to me this night
      | C#m          | A           B
But she couldn't find how to push through


#Bridge
| B     | B
  I stay   I pray
  |  E     A    | B
See you in heaven far away
| B     | B
  I stay   I pray
  | E      A     | B
See you in heaven   one day

#Ending
| E                     | B               | C#m      A     | B
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
| E                        | B
The night was heavy and the air was alive
     | C#m           A          | B
But she couldn't find how to push through


| C#m   | A   | B                | E         B
               Carried away by a moonlight shadow
| C#m   | A   | B                | E         B
              Carried away by a moonlight shadow
| E     |B    | C#m  A        | B
              Far away on the other side.
