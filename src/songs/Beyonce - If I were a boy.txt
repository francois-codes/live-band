If I were a boy

#Verse 1
               Em   C    G
If I were a boy
     D             Em    C    G
Even just for a day
D               Em         C
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
    G               D           Em   C    G
And throw on what I wanted and go

      D               Em   C    G
Drink beer with the guys
    D                Em   C    G   D
And chase after girls
         Em            C
I'd kick it with who I wanted
        G             D
And I'd never get confronted for it
Em              C              G
  'Cause they'd stick up for me


#Chorus
   D          Em   C    G
If I were a boy
          D             Em   C    G   D
I think I could understand
       Em              C
How it feels to love a girl
  G              D          Em   C    G
I swear I'd be a better man

    D           Em   C    G
I'd listen to her
        D              Em   C    G   D
Cause I know how it hurts
         Em               C
When you lose the one you wanted
           G             D
Cause he's taken you for granted
    C
And everything you had got destroyed


#Verse 2
               Em   C    G
If I were a boy
        D              Em    C    G    D
I would turn off my phone
     Em            C
Tell everyone it's broken
        G                D           Em   C    G
So they think that I was sleeping alone

    D             Em    C    G
I'd put myself first
             D          Em   C    G    D
And make the rules as I go
        Em              C                 
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
G            D          Em   C    G    
Waiting for me to come home


#Chorus
   D          Em   C    G
If I were a boy
          D            Em   C    G   D
I think I could understand
       Em              C
How it feels to love a girl
  G              D          Em   C    G
I swear I'd be a better man

    D           Em   C    G
I'd listen to her
        D              Em   C    G   D
Cause I know how it hurts
         Em               C
When you lose the one you wanted
           G             D
Cause he's taken you for granted
    C                           Am7
And everything you had got destroyed


#Bridge
 Am7       C            G        D         Am
    It's a little too late for you to come back
         C         Em
Say it's just a mistake
           D             Am
Think I forgive you like that
          C              Em         D
If you thought I would wait for you
            C
You thought wrong


#Verse 3
                  Em   C    G
But you're just a boy
          D       Em          C          G     D
You don't understand (yea you don't understand)
         Em              C
How it feels to love a girl, someday you'll
G              D                 Em   C   G
Wish you were a.. better man

            D        Em   C   G
You don't listen to her
          D             Em   C   G
You don't care how it hurts
D           Em             C
  Until you lose the one you wanted
                G                 D
Cause you've taken her for granted
    C
And everything you had got destroyed
                     Em  C   G   D
But you're just a boy
