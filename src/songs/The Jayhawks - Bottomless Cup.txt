english pop folk 90s

#intro
E          F#m (2x)

#verse
F#m                         E

Walk me to the bus, Tell me it's alright
F#m                         E

Talk the man out of the first drink and drive
F#m                         E

Rock away my terror after I burn the place down

B                    C#m
But you know the years make things different
B                    C#m
If you go, the bottomless cup runs out
B                    B7  (NC)
You never gave up on me

#chorus
                    A          E
I think I let you down
B
I could use you around
               A          E
Use you right now
F#m
There's nothing quite like the sound of
A     E
Your voice in the evening
A     G#m
Calling my name
A     E
It's getting late

#verse
F#m                         E

You used to say "I love you" a hundred times a day
F#m                         E

What ya gonna say when you learn they turned me
F#m                         E

The day is gonna come for something to take you

B                    C#m
But it's clear nothing comes near to you
B                    C#m
When you go I lower my sights
B               B7       NC
You never gave up on me

#chorus
                    A          E
I think I let you down
B
I could use you around
               A          E
Use you right now
     F#m
There's nothing quite like the sound of
A     E
Your voice in the evening
A     G#m
Calling my name
A     E
It's getting late

#Bridge
F#m           G#m
But I can't wait to get on back (x4)
C#m     C#m7     Amaj7
I ought to get back
C#m     C#m7     F#
I ought to get back
C#m     C#m7     Amaj7
I ought to get back
C#m     C#m7     F#
I ought to get back
