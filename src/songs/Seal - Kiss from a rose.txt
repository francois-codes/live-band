Gm      F    G
Duba dabu dubiduu...
Gm      F    G
Duba dabu dubiduu...

#Verse 1
G                            Eb     F           G
  There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
               Eb           F            G
You became the light on the dark side of me
                   F               C            G
But love remains a drug that´s the high not the pill
                              Gm
But did you know that when it snows,
   Eb          F             Eb             F              G
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can´t be seen

#Chorus
  G                     Eb          F           G
Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
                               Eb          F        G
Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
                  Eb         F
And now that your rose is in bloom
  Eb             F            G
A light hits the gloom on the grey

#Bridge
Gm      F    G
Duba dabu dubiduu...

#Verse 2
G                            Eb          F           G
  There is so much a man can tell you so much he can say
              Eb        F            G     N.C.
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby,
   Eb                         F                      G
to me you´re like a growing addiction that I can´t deny
                          Eb           F
Won´t you tell me is that healthy baby
            G                 Gm
But did you know that when it snows,
   Eb          F             Eb             F              G
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can´t be seen

#Chorus
  G                     Eb          F           G
Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
                               Eb          F        G
Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
                  Eb         F
And now that your rose is in bloom
  Eb             F            G
A light hits the gloom on the grey

I´ve been kissed by a rose (on the grey)
Fsus2       Csus2       Bb          Fsus2

But did you know that when it snows,
   Eb          F             Eb             F           G
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can´t be seen
