    In the days of my youth,
          D            A             E - - D - A
    I was told what it means to be a man.

    Now I've reached that age,
                  D            A                 E - - D - A
    I've tried to do all those things the best I can.
       E                           D            A        E - - D - A
    No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam.

A           G     D       A             G   D
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share,
        B7               A    E
when my woman left home for a brown-eyed man,
        B7                      B7 NC
well, I still don't seem to care.

    Sixteen: I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be,
    F#
    it only took a couple of days till she was rid of me.
    F#
    She swore that she would be all mine, and love me till the end,
    F#
    but when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oooh.

B           A      E       B             A     E
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share,

when my woman left home for a brown-eyed man,
        C#7                     C#7 NC
well, I still don't seem to care.

E                                   D - A
    Oh, I know what it means to be alone,
E                          D     A
    I sure do wish I was at home.
E                         D             A
    I don't care what the neighbors say,
E                          D                A
    I'm gonna love you each and every day.
      E                               D    A
    You can feel the beat within my heart.
      E                        D                A
    realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part....
