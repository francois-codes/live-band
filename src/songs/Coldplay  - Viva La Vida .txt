#verse 1
Fm        Dbsus2   Absus4/Eb
I used to rule the world, Seas
Ab                         Fm
would rise when I gave the word.
Fm                  Dbsus2   Absus4/Eb
Now in the morning I sleep  alone, sweep the streets
Ab         Fm
I used to own.

| Db   | Eb   | Ab  | Fsus2  |


#verse 2
Fsus2     Dbsus2   Absus4/Eb
I used to roll the dice, Feel the
Ab                 Fm
fear in my enemy's eyes.
Fm            Dbsus2     Absus4/Eb
Listen as the crowd would sing,"Now the..
Ab                Fm
old king is dead! Long live the king!"

#verse 3
Fm           Dbsus2   Absus4/Eb
One minute I held the key, Next the
Ab                   Fm
walls were closed on me.
Fm                       Dbsus2  Absus4/Eb
And I discovered that my castles stand, upon
Ab                  Fm
pillars of salt and pillars of sand.

#Chorus
   Db             Ebsus4
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing,
Ab            Fm
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing.
Db               Ebsus4
Be my mirror, my sword and shield,
Ab              Fm
My missionaries in a foreign field.

Db              Eb
For some reason I can't explain,
Ab/C                 Fm
Once you go there was never,
Fm       Dbmaj7 Ebsus4
Never an honest word. and
Abmaj7                    Fm
that was when I ruled the world.

#verse 4
Fm                    Dbsus2 Absus4/Eb
It was the wicked and wild   wind, blew
Ab                       Fm
down the doors to let me in.
Fm                       Dbsus2   Absus4/Eb
Shattered windows and the sound of drums, people
Ab               Fm
couldn't believe what I'd become.

#verse 5
Fm         Db   Eb
Revolutionaries wait, for
Ab                 Fm
my head on a silver plate.
Fm                  Dbsus2 Absus4/Eb
Just a puppet on a lonely string, oh
Ab                     Fm
who would ever want to be king?

#Chorus
   Db             Ebsus4
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing,
Ab            Fm
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing.
Db               Ebsus4
Be my mirror, my sword and shield,
Ab              Fm
My missionaries in a foreign field.


Db              Eb
For some reason I can't explain,
Ab/C                 Fm
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Fm       Dbmaj7 Ebsus4
Never an honest word. and
Abmaj7                    Fm
that was when I ruled the world.
