            Am                G
said it was 96 degrees in the shade
Am                       G
ten thousand soldiers on parade
Am                       G
taking i and i to meet a big fat boy
Am                       G
sent from overseas the queen employ


Am
excellency before you i come
        G
with my representation
                   Am            G
you know where i'm coming from
    Am
you caught me on the loose fighting to be free
        G
now you show me a noose on the cotton tree
     Am
entertainment for you
       G          E
martyrdom for me

<Am            G
some may suffer  and some may burn
<Am                    G
but i know that one day   my people will learn
<Am                        G
as sure as the sun shines,  way up in the sky
<Am                          G
today i stand here a victim     the truth is i'll never die
