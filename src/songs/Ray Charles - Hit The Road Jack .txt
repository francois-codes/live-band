Oh woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean,

You're the meanest woman I've ever seen.
  Am       G   F   E7
I guess if you say so
     Am      G       F          E7
I'll have to pack my things and go.

Now baby, listen baby, don't-a treat me this-a way
    Am           G     F         E7
For I'll be back on my feet some day.

Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood
    Am           G              F        E7
you ain't got no money you just ain't no good.
       Am       G   F   E7
Well I guess if you say so
     Am      G       F          E7
I'll have to pack my things and go. (That's right !!)
