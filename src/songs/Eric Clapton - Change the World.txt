If I could reach the stars, pull one down for you.
E       E6    E7     E7           E6      E
Shinin' on my heart, so you could see the truth.
A         A6          A7      A7      A6    A
Then this love I have inside, is everything it seems

But for now I find, its only in my dreams

If I could be king,  even for a day.
E            E6    E7      E7          E6       E
I'd take you as my queen.  I'd have it no other way.
G# A       A6         A7         A7      A6      A
   And our love would rule, this kingdom we have made.
E             E6   E7    E7     E6      G#7
Till then I'd be a fool, wishin for the day...
