#Intro
|F  C  Dm  C  | Bb  C  F  F  |


#Verse 1
Gm                      C
When are you gonna come down
F                     Bb
When are you going to land
 Eb                       C
I should have stayed on the farm, should have
F                  F
Listened to my old man
    Gm                        C
You know you can't hold me FOREVER
  F                   Bb
I didn't sign up with you
    Eb                     C
I'm not a present for your friends to open
     F                     F
This boy's too young to be singing
    Bbm7  Eb   Ab  Db   Bbm  C7
The blues... Ah...... Ah....


#Chorus
   F                    A7
So goodbye yellow brick road
          Bb              F
Where the dogs of society howl
    D7                     Gm
You can't plant me in your penthouse
    C                F
I'm going back to my plow
Dm                      A
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Bb                     Db
Hunting the horny back toad
Db Eb   F         C/E      Dm       Dm/C
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
   Bb      C            Bb7m  Eb
Beyond the yellow brick road ...
Ab  Db  | Bbm  C | F     |
Ah..... Ah......


#Verse 2
Gm                       C
What do you think you'll do then?
  F                            Bb
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
      Eb                   C
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
   F                      F
To set you on your feet again
Gm                   C
Maybe you'll get a replacement
        F                    Bb
There's plenty like me to be found
Eb           C
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
F                         F
Sniffing for tidbits like you
      Bb7m  Eb    Ab  Db  Bbm  C7
On the ground... Ah....  Ah....


#Chorus
   F                    A7
So goodbye yellow brick road
          Bb              F
Where the dogs of society howl
    D7                     Gm
You can't plant me in your penthouse
    C                F
I'm going back to my plow
Dm                      A
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Bb                     Db
Hunting the horny back toad
Db Eb   F         C/E      Dm       Dm/C
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
   Bb      C            Bb7m  Eb
Beyond the yellow brick road ...
Ab  Db  Bbm  C  F
Ah..... Ah......
