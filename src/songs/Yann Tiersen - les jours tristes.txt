#Verse 1
     Gm    Eb                      Gm
It's hard, hard not to sit on your hands
    Eb                    Gm
And bury your head in the sand
Eb                     Gm
Hard not to make other plans
    Eb                             F        Eb
And claim that you've done all you can all along
    F            Eb
And life must go on

     Gm    Eb                          Gm
It's hard, hard to stand up for what's right
    Eb                        Gm
And bring home the bacon each night
Eb                         Gm
Hard not to break down and cry
     Eb                F              Eb
When every idea you've tried has been wrong
        F          Eb
But you must carry on


#Chorus
     Bb            F                   Gm
It's hard, but you know it's worth the fight
       D                             Bb
'cause you know you've got the truth on your side
         F           Gm        D
When the accusations fly, hold tight
Bb        F                     Gm
Don't be afraid of what they'll say
D                             Bb
Who cares what cowards think, anyway?
          F              Gm       D
They will understand one day, one day


#Verse 2
     Gm    Eb                         Gm
It's hard, hard when you're here all alone
    Eb                     Gm
And everyone else has gone home
Eb                        Gm
Harder to know right from wrong
     Eb                F              Eb
When all objectivities gone, and it's gone
        F           Eb
But you still carry on

       Gm   Eb                   Gm
'cause you, you are the only one left
    Eb                          Gm
And you've got to clean up this mess
    Eb                          Gm
You know you'll end up like the rest
Eb                   F             Eb
Bitter and twisted unless you stay strong
        F     Eb
And you carry on


#Chorus
     Bb            F                   Gm
It's hard, but you know it's worth the fight
       D                             Bb
'cause you know you've got the truth on your side
         F           Gm        D
When the accusations fly, hold tight
Bb        F                     Gm
Don't be afraid of what they'll say
D                             Bb
Who cares what cowards think, anyway?
          F              Gm       D        Gm
They will understand one day, one day, one day

'cause you know you've got the truth on your side

Don't be afraid of what they'll say
D                             Bb

They will understand one day, one day, one day
