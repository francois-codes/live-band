King for a day
Jamiroquai
Eb
English groove pop 90s


#Verse 1
Eb         Abm
There's no way
Abdim              Eb
I'm coming back to you
  Eb              Abm
I just stopped to say
     Abdim                  Eb
That everything we did is through

     Eb           Abm
You tried to undermine
     Abdim              Eb
The better ranges of my nature
     Eb                  Abm
But soon you're going to find
      Abdim                      Eb
You should have started talking straighter


#Pre-Chorus
Gbm          Gdim
Now don't you worry
Ab7sus4         A
I won't put you down
Gbm        Gdim
I'm in no hurry, babe
           Ab7sus4  A
To see you go to   ground


#Chorus
             Gbm7              Gdim
Because it's true what they say
               Ab7               A
You know, it's true what they say
            Gbm7           Gdim
You're only king for a day
              Ab7           A
I hope you're happy that way


#Verse 2
Eb          Abm
There's no hope
Abdim                  Eb
For peace and reconciliation
       Eb                 Abm
You're quick to play your hand
    Abdim                      Eb
But what you haven't learnt is patience

   Eb              Abm
So look before you leap
   Abdim                         Eb
To tell the world your coloured story
       Eb                 Abm
It's clear your talk is cheap
   Abdim                 Eb
Do anything to get your glories


#Pre-Chorus
Gbm            Gdim
So spread your wings and fly
Ab7sus4         A
There is no doubt
Gbm        Gdim
You're so sure inside, you've got something to
Ab7sus4    A
Shout about


#Chorus
             Gbm7              Gdim
Because it's true what they say
               Ab7               A
You know, it's true what they say
            Gbm7           Gdim
You're only king for a day
               Ab7           A
I guess you're happy that way


#Verse 3 (No rythmic)
     Eb         Abm
And there's no love
Abdim              Eb
Ever to be lost between us
  Eb               Abm
I guess this is because
    Abdim                     Eb
The damage you've done is so grievous

Eb           Abm
So I hang my head
    Abdim                   Eb
To dwell on what might have been
    Eb               Abm
But what you left instead
Abdim         Eb
Pieces of a broken dream


#Pre-Chorus
Gbm          Gdim
Now don't you worry
Ab7sus4           A
I won't put you down
Gbm        Gdim
I'm in no hurry, babe
           Ab7sus4   A
To see you go to ground


#Chorus
             Gbm7              Gdim
Because it's true what they say
               Ab7               A
You know, it's true what they say
            Gbm7           Gdim
You're only king for a day
               Ab7           A
I guess you're happy that way


#Pre-Chorus
Gbm            Gdim
So spread your wings and fly
Ab7sus4      A
There is no doubt
Gbm        Gdim
You're so sure inside, you've got something to
Ab7sus4     A
Shout about


#Chorus
             Gbm7              Gdim
Because it's true what they say
               Ab7sus4         A
You know, it's true what they say
            Gbm7           Gdim
You're only king for a day
               Ab7sus4        A
I guess you're happy that way


#Outro
| Eb    Abm  | Abdim   Eb  |

| Eb    Abm  | Abdim   Eb  |

| Eb    Abm  | Abdim   Eb  |

Eb        Abm
Don't you see that
Abdim       Eb
You're only king for a day
            Eb           Abm
You must believe that...
