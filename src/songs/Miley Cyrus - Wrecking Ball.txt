#Intro
Dm   F   C   Bb


#Verse
    Dm                     F
 We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
    C                    Bb
 We jumped, never asking why
    Dm             F           
 We kissed, I fell under your spell
   C                  Bb
 A love no one could deny


#Pre-Chorus
 Bb                 Dm
 Don’t you ever say I just walked away
 F                  Bb
 I will always want you
 Bb                  Dm
 I can’t live a lie, running for my life
 F                  Bb*
 I will always want you


#Chorus
                  F
 I came in like a wrecking ball
 C              Dm
 I never hit so hard in love
 Bb                  F
 All I wanted was to break your walls
 C                     Dm   Bb
 All you ever did was wreck me
           Dm    Bb
 Yeah, you wreck me


#Verse
   Dm              F
 I put you high up in the sky
     C                      Bb
 And now, you’re not coming down
 Dm                    F
 It slowly turned, you let me burn
     C                       Bb
 And now, we’re ashes on the ground


#Pre-Chorus
 Bb                 Dm
 Don’t you ever say I just walked away
 F                  Bb
 I will always want you
 Bb                  Dm
 I can’t live a lie, running for my life
 F                  Bb*
 I will always want you


#Chorus
                  F
 I came in like a wrecking ball
 C              Dm
 I never hit so hard in love
 Bb                  F
 All I wanted was to break your walls
 C                     Dm   Bb
 All you ever did was wreck me
                  F
 I came in like a wrecking ball
 C                      Dm
 Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
 Bb                     F
 Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
 C                    Dm    Bb
 All you ever did was wreck me
           Dm    Bb
 Yeah, you wreck me


#Bridge
 Bb                       Dm
 I never meant to start a war
                             F
 I just wanted you to let me in
                      Am
 And instead of using force
                             Bb
 I guess I should’ve let you in
                          Dm
 I never meant to start a war
                             F
 I just wanted you to let me in
                             Am
 I guess I should’ve let you in

 Bb                 Dm
 Don’t you ever say I just walked away
 F                  Bb*
 I will always want you


#Chorus
                  F
 I came in like a wrecking ball
 C              Dm
 I never hit so hard in love
 Bb                  F
 All I wanted was to break your walls
 C                     Dm   Bb
 All you ever did was wreck me
                  F
 I came in like a wrecking ball
 C                      Dm
 Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
 Bb                     F
 Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
 C                    Dm    Bb
 All you ever did was wreck me
           Dm    Bb
 Yeah, you wreck me
           Dm    Bb
 Yeah, you wreck me
