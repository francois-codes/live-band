D      | D      | D      | D(2/4)|


#Verse 1:
Bm    A        G          D
You're so in love, little girl
Bm    A       G        D
So much in love little girl
Em         A              Bm
Running around in Circles-Why?
                A
You know it's a Crime

Bm A        G           D
No less, no More than a Rose
Bm A        G           D
No less, no More than a Rose
Em     A        Bm     
Try to attach a meaning
                A
To words that you heard

#Chorus 1:
G                     Bm
Stumblin' through the Dark
          G                     D
Seems I'm stumblin' through the Dark
            G                      | D      | D(2/4)|
Everybody's stumbling' through the Dark

#Verse 2:
Bm  A       G            D
The men who proceeded us here
Bm  A      G             D
left only Questions and fear
Em         A                Bm
The vanity formed by beauty lies
                A
you know it's a crime

#Chorus 2:
G                     Bm
Stumblin' through the Dark
          G                     D
Seems I'm stumblin' through the Dark
            G                      | D      |  D      | D(2/4)|
Everybody's stumbling' through the Dark
