#verse 1
D                         G
People ask me why I never find a place to stop
           D                C_G
and settle down, down, down
G     D                             G
But I never wanted all those things people need to justify
      D
their lives, lives, lives

Time was on my side when I was running down the street

it was no bind, bind, bind

A suitcase and an old guitar, is all I need to occupy
   D
my mind, mind, mind
