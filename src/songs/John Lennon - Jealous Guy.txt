#Verse 1
  G         Em              D   D6 # D7
      I was dreaming of the past
  D7                           Em   Em7
      and my heart was beating fast.
  Em6                    D    Dsus4 D
      I began to lose control,
  Em      Em7            C
      I began to lose control.

#Chorus
  G            Dm/F         C   Dsus4
      I didn't mean to hurt you,

      I'm sorry that I made you cry.
  G            G/F#           Em  Em7/D

      I was feeling insecure,
  D7                           Em   Em7
      you might not love me anymore.
  Em6                    D    Dsus4 D
      I was shivering inside,
  Em        Em7          C
      I was shivering inside.

#Chorus
  G            Dm/F         C   Dsus4

      I'm sorry that I made you cry.
   G            G/F#               Em   Em7/D
      Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you,

      I'm just a jealous guy.
