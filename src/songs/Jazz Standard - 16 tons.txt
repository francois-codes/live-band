Some people say a man is made outa mud
  Am                   F         E
A poor man's made outa muscle 'n blood...
Am         C         Dm       F
Muscle an' blood an' skin an' bone
  Am                     E           Am
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

     Am                        F       E
     You load sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
     Am                    F         E
     Another day older an' deeper in debt
     Am                 C              Dm      F
     Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go

     I owe my soul to the company sto'

#Verse
      Am                        F          E
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
  Am                        F           E
I picked up my shovel and I went to the mine
       Am      C              Dm   F
Loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
        Am                     E        Am
And the Strawboss said, "Well, Bless my soul

#Chorus

     You load sixteen tons an' whaddya get?

     Another day older an' deeper in debt
           Am           C              Dm      F
     Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go
       Am                 E       Am
     I owe my soul to the company sto'

#Verse
      Am                      F         E
I was born one morning it was drizzlin' rain
Am                       F         E
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
      Am            C                 Dm       F
I was raised in the cane-break by an' ol' mama hound
         Am                    E       Am
Ain't no high-tone woman gonna push me around.

#Chorus
              Am               F       E
     You load sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
      Am                   F         E
     Another day older an' deeper in debt
           Am           C              Dm      F
     Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go
       Am                 E       Am
     I owe my soul to the company sto'

#Verse
      Am                 F            E
If ya see me a- comin' ya better step aside
  Am        G         F           E
A lotta men din't an' a lotta men died
     Am          C            Dm       F
With one fist of iron an' the other of steel
       Am                             E        Am
If the right one don' getcha then the left one will.

#Chorus
              Am               F       E
     You load sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
      Am                   F         E
     Another day older an' deeper in debt
           Am           C              Dm      F
     Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go
       Am                 E       Am
     I owe my soul to the company sto'
