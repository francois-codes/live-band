#Verse 1:
Eb   Fm7     Gm        Fm7
Woman, I can hardly exp-ress,
Eb       Cm              Fm               Bbsus4_Bb
My mixed emotions and my thoughtless-ness.

After all, I'm for-ever in your debt.

And woman, I will try to exp-ress,
Eb       Cm              Fm        Bbsus4_Bb
My inner feelings and thankfulness.
Ab       Fm7       Gm            Bbsus4_Bb
For showing me the meaning of suc-cess.

The little child inside the man.
Ab        Fm7        Gm             Bbsus4_Bb
Please re-member, my life is in your hands.

And woman, hold me close to your heart,

However distant, don't keep us apart.
Ab        Fm7       Gm        Bbsus4_Bb
After all it is written in the st-ars.

#Chorus 2:
