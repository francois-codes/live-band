Jazz

#Verse 1
        D       F#dim7        Em7      A7
Another bride,        another June
        Dmaj7  D7      Gm9   Gm7
Another sunny     honeymoon
        D       F#dim7        Bb7    A7
Another season,       another reason
           D       F#dim7 Em7 A7
For makin' whoopee

#Verse 2
         D      F#dim7          Em7    A7
A lot of shoes,        a lot of rice
             Dmaj7    D7            Gm9   Gm7
The groom is nervous,    he answers twice
            D       F#dim7              Bb7     A7
It's really killin'        that he's so willin'
        D        A7  D
To make whoopee

#Chorus 1
F#dim7           Em
Picture a little love nest
Gm                   D
Down where the roses cling
F#dim7                 Em
Picture the same sweet love nest
Gm                    Bb7   A7
Think what a year can bring

#Verse 3
             D      F#dim7         Em7     A7
He's washin' dishes       and baby clothes
          Dmaj7   D7      Gm9   Gm7
He's so ambitious he even sews
             D         F#dim7                 Bb7       A7
But don't forget folks        that's what you get folks,
           D        F#dim7 Em7 A7
for makin' whoopee

#Verse 4
         D      F#dim7          Em7    A7
Now in a year,        or maybe  less
              Dmaj7  D7                     Gm9   Gm7
What's this I hear?      Well you can't you guess?
            D        F#dim7            Bb7     A7
She feels neglected,       and he's suspected
          D        F#dim7 Em7 A7
Of makin' whoopee

#Verse 5
          D     F#dim7           Em7     A7
She sits alone,       most every night
           Dmaj7  D7          Gm9   Gm7
He doesn't phone; he doesn't  write
             D     F#dim7              Bb7     A7
He says he's busy,       but she says "Is he?
            D        A7 D
He's makin' whoopee"

#Chorus 2
F#dim7               Em      Gm                 D
He doesn't make much money - only five thousand per
F#dim7                     Em    Gm                     Bb7 A7
Some judge who thinks he's funny says you'll pay six to her

#Verse 6
         D      F#dim7          Em     A7
He says,"Judge,       suppose I fail?"
                 Dmaj7 D7         Gm9   Gm7
The judge says: "Bud,  you  go to jail"
             D         F#dim7                 Bb7      A7
You'd better keep her,       youâ€™ll find it's cheaper
            D       F#dim7 Em7 A7
Than making whoopee
            D       F#dim7 Em7 A7
Than making whoopee
            D       A7  D
Than making whoopee
