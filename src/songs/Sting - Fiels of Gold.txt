D
Pop english 90s

#Verse 1
         Bsus2                G
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
                     D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bsus2                G      D
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B      A             Bm7 G D
As we walk in fields of gold


#Verse 2
       Bsus2                  G
So she took her love for to gaze awhile
                      D
Upon the fields of barley
     Bsus2                    G         D
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
     G/B   A           D
Among the fields of gold


#Verse 3
       Bsus2                    G
Will you stay with me, will you be my love
                        D
Among the fields of barley
       Bsus2                  G       D
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B      A           Bm7 G D
As we lie in fields of gold


#Verse 4
         Bsus2                  G
See the west wind move like a lover so
                     D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bsus2               G         D
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
     G/B   A          D
Among the fields of gold


#Bridge
G             D
I never made promises lightly
G                   D
And there have been some that I've broken
G                  D
But I swear in the days still left
       G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold
       G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold
