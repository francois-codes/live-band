(B) Oh holy night
    F                  C
The stars are brightly shining

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

(T) Long lay the world in sin and error pi ning
           Em             B7            Em
Till he ap pear'd and the soul felt its worth.
        G7                 C
(A) The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
    G7              C
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn !

#Verse 2
    C          C/E
(B) Led by the light
   F              C
of Faith serenely beaming
                           G7        C
with glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
    C         C/E        F            C    B7
(T) So led by light of a star sweetly glea ming
              Em       B7          Em
Here come the wise men from Orient land
        G7                C
(A) The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
   G7                     C
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Oh night      oh holly night  
G7         C
Oh night divine
