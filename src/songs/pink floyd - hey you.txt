#Verse 1
    Emadd9
Hey you! out there in the cold
                                     Bm
Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me
    Emadd9
Hey you! standing in the aisles
                                           Bm
With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me
D                               D7       G  D  C
Hey you! don't you help them to bury the light
Bm           Am         Em       Dm
Don't give in without a fight.

#Verse 2
    Emadd9
Hey you! out there on your own
                                     Bm
Sitting naked by the phone would you touch me
    Emadd9
Hey you! with your ear against the wall
                                          Bm
Waiting for someone to call out would you touch me
D                             D7        G  D  C
Hey you! would you help me to carry the stone
Bm              Am          Em
Open your heart, I'm coming home

#Instrumental
Am     Em     Am     Em     Am     Em

#Bridge
C          D      G D  C
But it was only a fantasy
C                D         G   D   C
The wall was too high, as you can see
C                D              G   D     C
No matter how he tried he could not break free
                  D7       Em   Dm   Em   Dm   Em   Dm   Em   Dm
And the worms ate into his brain.

#Verse 3
    Emadd9
Hey you! out there on the road
                                Bm
Doing what you're told, can you help me
G   Emadd9
Hey you! out there beyond the wall
                                      Bm
Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me
D                              D7         G  D  C
Hey you! don't tell me there's no hope at all
  Bm             Am           Emadd9
Together we stand, divided we fall.
