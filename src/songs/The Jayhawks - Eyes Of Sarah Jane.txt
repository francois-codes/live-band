G#m         C#m  G#m        C#m
Warwick Hotel ,   I know it well
G#m        E        C#         G#m        | G#m       |
We lived a dream so sweet, so sweet

G#m                 C#m
I see Philly in the snowy gloom
G#m                           C#m
We could have laid there 'til afternoon
G#m            E         C#        G#m
   Our cut runs deep, so deep, so deep

#Chorus:
F#           F#/E           E         
  And in the eyes of Sarah Jane
          B              F#
I see the happy times again
F#           F#/E           E         
And in the eyes of Sarah Jane
          B                G#m
I see the happy times again


#verse
G#m          C#m   G#m        C#m
We couldn't sleep, Laugh 'til we weep
G#m              E                   C#       | G#m        | G#m       |
Then time stood still, so still, so still

G#m                     C#m
Talked for hours in our little bed
G#m                       C#m
I fell in love with every word you said
G#m          E         C#         G#m
   It felt so great, so great, so great

#Chorus:
F#           F#/E           E         
  And in the eyes of Sarah Jane
          B              F#
I see the happy times again
F#           F#/E           E         
And in the eyes of Sarah Jane
          B                
I see the happy times again

A                         G#m
 People love to fall in
G#m                        B
 Love they love to fall in
B                       F#
 People love to be amused
A        
 But you won't see me laughing
E                         G#m     | C#m     |G#m     | C#m      |
 In the sadness of our ways

#instrumental (acoustic guitar piannissimo)
G#    | C#     | G#m     | C#m     |

G#                C#m
  Those were the days  (ouh ouh)
G#               C#m
  Those were the days

#Chorus: (2x)
F#           F#/E           E         
  And in the eyes of Sarah Jane
          B              F#
I see the happy times again
F#           F#/E           E         
And in the eyes of Sarah Jane
          B              F#
I see the happy times again

    Times again
