#Verse 1
Bb6                         Cm
Oh the shark bites with his teeth dear,
       F7                 Bb
And he shows them, pearly white.
       Gm7                Cm
Just a jack-knife has old Mack Heath babe,
       F7             Bb
And he keeps it outta sight.


#Verse 2
NC                 Bb6                  Cm
You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe,
        F7               Bb
Scarlet billows start to spread,
      Gm7                        Cm
Fancy gloves, though, wears Mack Heath babe,
           F7                      Bb
So there's never, never a trace of red.


#Verse 3
           Bb6                    Cm
Now on the sidewalk, oh on Sunday morning (don't ya know)
       F7                Bb
Lies a body, just oozin' life,
                Gm7                 Cm
Yeah, someone's sneakin' 'round the corner,
           F7                  Bb
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?


#Verse 4
          Bb6                 Cm
There's a tugboat down by the river, (don't 'cha know?)
       F7                             Bb
With a cement bag, just-a droopin' on down.
         Gm7                    Cm
Oh, that cement is just for the weight, dear,
               F        F7               Bb
Five'll get ya ten ol' Mackie's back in town.


#Verse 5
        Bb6
Now you heard about Louie Miller,
      Cm                    F7
He disappeared, babe, after drawin' out,
        Bb
All his hard earned cash.
             Gm7                   Cm
And now Mack he spends just like a sailor,
         F7                          Bb
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?


#Verse 6

Now Jenny Diver, oh, Sookey Tawdry,
      F7                   Bb
Polly Peachum and old Lucy Brown,
       Gm7               Cm
Oh the line forms on the right, babe,
             F7               Bb
Now that old Mackie's back in town.
