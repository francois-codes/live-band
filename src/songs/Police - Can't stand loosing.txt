#Intro
Dm   Gm   Dm   Gm

Dm   Gm   F    Gm


#Verse 1
Dm              Am      Gm      Gm
I've called you so many times today
      Dm             Am             Gm          Gm
And I guess it's all true what your girlfriends say
     Dm        Am           Gm      Gm
That you don't ever want to see me again
         Dm              Am               Gm       Gm
And your brother's gonna kill me and he's six feet ten

#Pre-Chorus
  Bb          F       Bb   F
I guess you'd call it cowardice
        C      G           C       Asus4
But I'm not prepared to go on like this


#Chorus
Bb
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Gm
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Asus4
I can't, I can't, I can't,

#Post-Chorus
                Dm Gm
I can't stand losing you
Dm    Gm            Dm       Gm
    I can't stand losing you
Dm    Gm            Dm       Gm
    I can't stand losing you
Dm    Gm            Dm       Gm
    I can't stand losing you


#Verse 2
Dm           Am      Gm      Gm
I see you've sent my letters back
       Dm Am          Gm          Gm
And my LP records and they're all scratched
  Dm            Am        Gm     Gm
I can't see the point in another day
     Dm     Am           Gm     Gm
When nobody listens to a word I say

#Pre-chorus
        Bb      F       Bb   F
You can call it lack of confidence
       C        G              C       Asus4
But to carry on living doesn't make no sense


#Chorus
Bb
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Gm
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Asus4
I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand losing you
Bb
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Gm
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Asus4
I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand losing


#Bridge
  D5
I guess this is our last goodbye
    D5
And you don't care so i won't cry
    D5
But you'll be sorry when I'm dead
    D5
And all this guilt will be on your head

#Pre-chorus
  Bb          F       Bb F
I guess you'd call it suicide
    C       G      C           Asus4
But I'm too full to swallow my pride


#Chorus
Bb
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Gm
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Asus4
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Bb
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Gm
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Asus4
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
C
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Asus4
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Bb
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
C
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Asus4
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
Bb
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
C                   Asus4
I can't, I can't, I can't stand

can't stand losing
