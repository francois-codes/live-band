G    Bm    C    D    x2

#Verse 1
G            Bm   C
I started a joke
                  D          G      Bm   C
Which started the whole world crying
    D         G   Bm   C
But I didn't see
          D         G   Bm  C  D
That the joke was on me, oh no

#Verse 2
G            Bm   C
I started to cry
                  D          G        Bm   C
Which started the whole world laughing
       D          G      Bm   C
Oh, if I'd only seen
         D            G
That the joke was on me

#Chorus
Em               Bm
I looked at the skies
             C            G
Running my hands over my eyes
    Bm            Em
And I fell out of bed
 D         Am
Hurting my head
                      D     N.C.
From things that I'd said

#Verse 3
G            Bm      C
'Til I finally died
                 D            G      Bm   C
Which started the whole world living
  C    D       G      Bm   C
Oh, if I'd only seen
         D           G
That the joke was on me

#Chorus
Em               Bm
I looked at the skies
             C            G
Running my hands over my eyes
    Bm            Em
And I fell out of bed
 D         Am
Hurting my head
                      D     N.C.
From things that I'd said

#Verse 4
G            Bm    C
'Til I finally died
                  D           G      Bm   C
Which started the whole world living
       D          G      Bm   C
Oh, if I'd only seen
         D           G   Bm   C
That the joke was on me
