#Intro
| Bbm    Bbm/Ab   | Gbmaj7    F7    |


#Verse
Bb6               Ebmaj7     F        F/Eb    Dm7
If you search for tenderness it isn't hard to find
Ebmaj7           Gm7             | Am7    Cm7 F7 |   
You can have the love you need to live
Bb                        Csus      C         F/C     A/C#    Dm
And if you look for truth-ful- ness you might just as well be blind
   Ebmaj7           A             D
It always seems to be so hard to give


#Chorus
Ebmaj7   F7  D/F#             Gm7  Gm7/F
Honest-  y   is such a lonely word
Eb          F       Bb    D
Everyone is so untrue
Ebmaj7   F7  D               Gm7
Honest-  y   is hardly ever heard
Eb                F          | Bb   Bbm  |  Gbmaj7   F7  |
But mostly what I need from you


#Verse
Bb           Eb           F                 Dm7
I can always find someone to say they sympathize
Eb           Gm              | Am7    Cm7 F7 |
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
Bb                    C              F                 D
But I don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies
Eb            A               D
All I want is someone to believe


#Chorus
Ebmaj7   F7  D                Gm7  F
Honest-  y   is such a lonely word
Eb          F       Bb    D
Everyone is so untrue
Ebmaj7   F7  D               Gm7
Honest-  y   is hardly ever heard
Eb                F           | Bb   Bbm  |  Gbmaj7   F7  |
But mostly what I need from you


#Bridge
Gm                  D/G
I can find a lover, I can find a friend
Fm6                            C/E
I can have security until the bitter end
Ebmaj7      F         F7    Eb/Bb       Bb
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
     C7     | F    D/F# | Ebmaj7   F7  |
I know, I know

Bb                Eb        F        F/Eb Dm           
When I'm deep inside of me, don't be too  concerned
Eb               Bb              | Am7    Cm7 F7 |        
I won't ask for nothing while I'm gone
Bb             C                    F    A     Dm
When I want sincerity tell me where else can I turn?
       Eb                 A7         D7
Cause you're the one that I depend upon


#Outro
