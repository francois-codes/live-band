#Intro:
| Bm    | D7    | E2     | Em   A   |

#Verse 1
Bm     A/C#     |  E2                    |  Bm   
You're only just a dreamboat, sailing in my head
    A/C#        |  E2                    |  Bm   
You swim my secret oceans of coral blue and red
     A/C#          |  E2                          |  Gmaj9      
Your smell is incense burning, your touch is silk and yet
                   |  D                |   Gmaj9                |  F#4 F# NC
It reaches through my skin, Moving from within, it clutches at my breast


#Chorus
NC                  | Bm                  |  D7b11
But it's only when I sleep, I see you in my dreams,
               | E2                   |  Em      A  
Got me spinning round and round, turning upside down
                   | Bm                    |  D7b11      
But I only hear you breathe, somewhere in my sleep,
              | E2                     | Em     A  
Got me spinning round and round, turning upside down
                   | Bm   ->
But it's only when I sleep

#Verse 2
        A/C#           | E2                        | Bm   
And   when I wake from slumber, your shadow's disappeared
     A/C#          |  E2                    |  Bm   
Your breath is just a sea mist surrounding my body
    A/C#             |  E2                         |  Gmaj9      
I'm working through the daytime but when it's time to rest
             |  D               |   Gmaj9                    |  F#4 F# NC
I'm lying in my bed, listening to my breath, falling from the edge

#Chorus
NC                  | Bm                  |  D7b11
But it's only when I sleep, I see you in my dreams,
               | E2                   |  Em      A  
Got me spinning round and round, turning upside down
                   | Bm                    |  D7b11      
But I only hear you breathe, somewhere in my sleep,
              | E2                     | Em     A  
Got me spinning round and round, turning upside down
                   | Gmaj7     
But it's only when I sleep  (Yeah Yeah Yeah)

 | E7
       Yeah Yeah Yeah
 |Â D              |  F#
   Yeeeaaaah   Yeeeaaaah
      NC         |  Bm ->
But it's only when I sleep

#Solo
| Bm    | D7    | E2     | Em   A   |

| Bm    | D7    | E2     | Em   A   |

Gmaj7                      |  D
     It's reaching through my skin
             |  Gmaj7
Moving from within
                |  F#        |
And clutches at my breast   

#Chorus
| NC                  | Bm                  |  D7b11
But it's only when I sleep, I see you in my dreams,
               | E2                   |  Em      A  
Got me spinning round and round, turning upside down
                   | Bm                    |  D7b11      
But I only hear you breathe, somewhere in my sleep,
              | E2                     | Em     A  
Got me spinning round and round, turning upside down
                   | Bm       
But it's only when I sleep
