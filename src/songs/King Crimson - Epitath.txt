#intro
| Em      | D/F#     | Am      | B#5   B  |  (2x)


#Verse
     Em            D/F#
The wall on which the prophets wrote
   Am              B#5   B
Is cracking at the seams.
 Em         D/F#    
Upon the instruments of death
Am                    B#5   B
The sunlight brightly gleams.

Em                D/F#
When every man is torn apart
Am                  B#5   B
With nightmares and with dreams,
     Em         D/F#
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
Am                  B#5   B
When silence drowns the screams.


#Chorus
Em                   Bm
Confusion will be my epitaph.
     Em              Bm   
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
      Em                 Bm
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh.

      C                    Bm   
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
      C                    Bm
Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
      C                    B
Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
| Em      | D/F#     | Am      | B#5   B  |  (2x)


#Verse
  Em           D/F#
Between the iron gates of fate,
Am                B#5   B
The seeds of time were sown,
    Em           D/F#
And watered by the deeds of those
    Am         B#5   B
Who know and who are known;

Em            D
Knowledge is a deadly friend
   Am           B#5   B
If no one sets the rules.
    Em            D
The fate of all mankind I see
   Am              B#5   B
Is in the hands of fools.
