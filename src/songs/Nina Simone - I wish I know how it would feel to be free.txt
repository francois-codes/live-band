#Verse 1
  F    A7     Dm  F        Bb   C9    F
I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
       Bb      F             C      G7      C7
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
  F    A7      Dm  F7      Bb          C9       F
I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Bdim    F     A7      Dm
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
Bdim    F           C9sus4   F
For the whole round world to hear

#Verse 2
  F    A7      Dm    F       Bb          C9    F
I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
       Bb      F         C    G7 C7
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
  F    A7        Dm   F7      Bb    C9    F
I wish you could know what it means to be me
Bdim       F   A7  Dm
Then you'd see and agree
Bdim       F   C9sus4    F
That every man should be free

#Verse 3
  F    A7      Dm   F       Bb   C9    F
I wish I could give all I'm longin' to give
       Bb      F             C   G7     C7
I wish I could live like I'm longin' to live
  F    A7      Dm F7      Bb          C9    F
I wish I could do all the things that I can do
Bdim           F   A7   Dm
And though I'm way over due
Bdim   F  C9sus4 F
I'd be starting anew

#Verse 4
       F    A7      Dm F      Bb   C9      F
Well I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
          Bb       F       C     G7      C7
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
       F    A7     Dm  F7       Bb   C9     F
Oh I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
Bdim     F     A7      Dm
Then I'd sing 'cause I know
Bdim   F     C9sus4 F
How it feels to be free

Bdim  F     A7    Dm
Yes I know, oh, I know
Bdim   F     C9sus4 F
How it feels to be free
