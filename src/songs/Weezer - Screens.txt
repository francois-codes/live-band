Young girl, lyin' flat in her bed
Bm   E   A    D         Bm    E  A  D
Streaming images to her head
Bm    E             A         D
  Homework or memes, slime or BLACKPINK
Bm      E          A        D
  Eight hours gone, now her mind's blown
Bm  E     A          D       Bm   E  A  D
She don't, she don't want me here

D                     A
Now the real world is dying

As everybody moves into the cloud

Can you tell me where we're going?

Old maid in the cottage nеxt door

We don't see her much anymore
Bm          E        A       D
  She plays Solitaire on her desktop
Bm         E            A        D
  Searches for her kids, now she can't stop
Bm  E  A            D           Bm    E  A  D
Did she think she'd go out this way?
