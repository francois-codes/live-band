#Intro
| Dm  Em  F  G |  A7      NC |


#Chorus
                Dm    Am
This is a man's world
          Dm           Am
This is a man's world
Gm
But it would be nothing
A                       Dm       Am    Dm    Am
Nothing without a woman or a girl


#Verse 1
        Dm                Am
You see man made the cars
Dm                      Am
To take us over the road
Dm                 Am
Man made the train
Dm                 Am
To carry the heavy load

Dm             Am
Man made the electro lights
Dm                    Am
To take us out of the dark
Dm           Am
Man made the boat for the water
Dm                 Am
Like Noah made the ark


#Chorus
          Gm
This is a man's man's, man's world
A
But it would be nothing
                        Dm        Am   Dm   Am
Nothing without a woman or a girl


#Verse 2
Dm                 Am
Man thinks about a little baby girls
Dm               Am
      And a baby boys
Dm            Am
Man make them happy
Dm                    Am
'Cause man makes them toys

Dm            Am
And after man make everything,
      Dm            Am
Everything he can
                        Dm     Am
You know that man makes money
            Dm          Am
To buy from other man


#Chorus
          Gm
This is a man's world
                A
But it would be nothing, nothing
%
Not one little thing
                Dm        Am    Dm    Am
Without a woman or a girl


#Outro
           Dm                   Am
He's lost        In the wilderness
Dm         Am
  He's lost
Dm         Am
  And bitterness
Dm               Am
  He's lost, lost and ...
