#Intro (12/8)
| Cmaj7     | Gmaj7     | Am      | Gmaj7    |


#Verse 1
Cmaj7
Don't be that way
      Gmaj7
Fall apart twice a day
       Am                          Gmaj7
I just wish you could feel what you say
Cmaj7
Show, never tell
      Gmaj7
But I know you too well
        Am                        Dsus2   D
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

#Chorus
   Cmaj7
If teardrops could be bottled
           Gmaj7
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
            Am                              B7
Told "that tight dress is what makes you a whore"
      Cmaj7
If "I love you" was a promise
          Gmaj7
Would you break it, if you're honest
         Am                                 D   Dsus2  D
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
Cmaj7     B7      | Em       | %        |

#Verse 2
Cmaj7
Hands getting cold
       Gmaj7
Losing feeling's getting old
      Am              Gmaj7
Was I made from a broken mold?
Cmaj7
Hurt, I can't shake
           Gmaj7
We've made every mistake
     Am                    D   Dsus2  D
Only you know the way that I break

#Chorus
   Cmaj7
If teardrops could be bottled
           Gmaj7
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
            Am                              B7
Told "that tight dress is what makes you a whore"
      Cmaj7
If "I love you" was a promise
          Gmaj7
Would you break it, if you're honest
         Am                                 D   Dsus2  D
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
