#Intro
| C#m     | Amaj7     | C#m     | Amaj7     |


#Verse 1
C#m         Amaj7
  Turn the key
C#m           Amaj7
  And step into the blackness
C#m          Amaj7
  Lamplight falls
C#m            Amaj7
  And casts a laughing phantom

C#m   Amaj7
  I imagine your smile
        C#m                       Amaj7
And the life that we could share
C#m             Amaj7
  But with the last of my steps
          C#m                Amaj7
I see the truth lying there


#Chorus
     F#m    B
Dead roses
                    E          G#7
At the bottom of an oubliette
                             C#m              Amaj7
Where they beat you 'til you begged to live
                          B           E
You are mine and you were always mine
                    F#m          B
Now I'm crying over dead roses
                       E   G#7
I could never let them go


#Verse 2
C#m         Amaj7
  A winged beast
C#m            Amaj7
  With horns upon his cranium
C#m        Amaj7
  Slinks away
C#m              Amaj7
  And grinning, mak–µs his way up

C#m            Amaj7
  I grasp the pieces of rose
         C#m                  Amaj7
And your raven locks of hair
C#m           Amaj7
  I hear the turn of the key
     C#m                   Amaj7
As I hiss my final prayer

#Chorus
     F#m     B
Dead roses
                    E         G#7
At the bottom of an oubliette
                             C#m           Amaj7
Where they beat you 'til you beg to live
                          B           E
You are mine and you were always mine
                    F#m          B
Now I'm crying over dead roses
                       E   G#7
I could never let them go


#Outro
| C#m     | Amaj7     | C#m     | Amaj7     |

| C#m     | Amaj7     | C#m     | Amaj7     |

| C#m     | Amaj7     | C#m     | Amaj7     |
