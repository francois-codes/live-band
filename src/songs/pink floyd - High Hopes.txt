#Verse
Cm            Cm7           Ab                              Cm
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
              Cm7                 Ab
In a world of magnets and miracles
Cm                      Cm7              Ab
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
Cm                   Cm7                 Ab
The ringing of the division bell had begun

              Bb            G7
Along the long road and on down the causeway
Ab             Bb            G7
Do they still meet there by the cut.


#Verse 2
Cm            Cm7           Ab                              Cm
There was a ragged band who followed in our footsteps
              Cm7                 Ab
Running before times took our dreams away
Cm                      Cm7              Ab
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tieus to the ground
Cm                   Cm7                 Ab
To a life consumed by slow decay


#Chorus
                 Cm    Gm   Ab   Bb
The grass was greener
                 Cm    Dm Eb   Fm   Gm Ab
The light was brighter
                 Cm   Gm   Ab   Bb
When friends surrounded
                 Cm    Dm Eb   Fm   Gm Ab
The nights of wonder



#Verse 3
Cm            Cm7           Ab                              Cm
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
              Cm7                 Ab
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Cm                      Cm7              Ab
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Cm                   Cm7                 Ab
Dragged by the force of some sleeping tide
              Bb            G7
at a higher altitude with flag unfurled
Ab             Bb            G7
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

#Verse 4
Cm            Cm7           Ab                              
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
Cm              Cm7                 Ab
Theres a hunger still unsatisfied
Cm                      Cm7              Ab
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Cm                   Cm7                 Ab
Though down this road I've been so many times


#Chorus 2
                 Cm    Gm   Ab   Bb
The grass was greener
                 Cm    Dm Eb   Fm   Gm Ab
The light was brighter
                 Cm   Gm   Ab   Bb
When friends surrounded
                 Cm    Dm Eb   Fm   Gm Ab
The nights of wonder

                 Cm    Gm   Ab   Bb
With friends surrounded
                 Cm    Dm Eb    Fm   Gm Ab            
The dawn mist glowing
                 Cm    Gm   Ab   Bb
The water flowing
                 Cm    Dm  Eb   Fm   Gm  Ab
The endless river
                 Cm    Gm  Ab   Bb
Forever and ever
