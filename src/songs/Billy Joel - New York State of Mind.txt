  Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood
F                | A7              |  Dm          | Bb9    |
   Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
C      E7/B      |   Am7       C/G     |  F      C/E   | D7    |

   I seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines
F                |  A7             |  Dm      |  Bb9    |
   Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
C        E7/B      |   Am7     C/G   |  F             C/E     |  D7   |
   But I know what I'm needing    and I don't want to waste more time

#Chorus
Am7         |  D7      |  Gmaj7      |  G    |
   It was so easy living     day by day
Gm7           | C7                 |   Fmaj7   | Fmaj7   |
   Out of touch    with the rhythm and blues
Bm7           | E7        |   Amaj7       |  Amaj7  |
    Well, now I need a little       give and take
    Am7           |  D7   |

  It comes down to reality and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
F                    |  A7            | Dm     |  Bb9    |
    Don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
C     E7/B         | Am7      C/G | F           C/E | D7      |
