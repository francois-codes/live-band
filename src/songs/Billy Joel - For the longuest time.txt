If you said goodbye to me tonight
Eb     Eb/D__Eb/C__Eb/Bb__F              Bb
There would still be music left to write

Bb                Cm
Maybe this won't last very long

I haven't been there for the longest time

I said to myself

Now I know the woman that you are

I have been a fool for lesser things

I want you so bad
