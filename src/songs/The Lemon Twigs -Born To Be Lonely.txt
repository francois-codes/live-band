#Intro (4/4)
| B/F#   Emaj7  | Ebm/Gb  Eb/G  | Abm   G   |  Am   D D6  |

#Verse 1
| Emaj7  Amaj7 | B       Cdim7    | Dbm  C
  Her   songs,    Been the same for so  long
| F        G  G#dim7 | Am
  The refrain  goes   on
          Ab+5        | C/G    F#m7b5
  Like the dawn with no one to see it
| Fm7            Bb6 | F#m       B7
  But she keeps singing like she means it

| Emaj7  Amaj7 | B             Cdim7      | Dbm  C
  New   games,     She's never learned play to - day
| F            G    G#dim7 | Am
  She can't discern  the    rules
            Ab+5  | Ebdim7  Ab (6 /4)
  But she's not a  fool

#Chorus (6/4)
| Dbmaj7  | Ebm  | Ebm7/A Ab   | Dbmaj7
  I wasn't only    born    to be lonely
| Dbmaj7    | Ebm    | Ab   Abaug | Ebm  Ab Ab/Bb Ab/C
  I need a new love To keep me   alive
| Dbmaj7   | Ebm       | Ebm7/A Ab   | Dbmaj7
  No use in crying out, I      now am finding out
| Dbmaj7   | Ebm     | Ebm7/A Ab   | Dbmaj7 (4/4)
  Show me a true love,  give  me  a  sign

#Verse 2 (4/4)
| Emaj7  Amaj7 | B          Cdim  | Dbm  C
  Her love's,     just the same as your lovе
| F          G     G#dim7 | Am
   Now it's stained  and   worn
          Ab+5  | C/G   F#m7b5
  Its a door to another season
| Fm7             Bb6         | F#m        B7
    She sleeps alone,  thinks, "What's the reason?"
| Emaj7  Amaj7 | B      Cdim7   | Dbm  C
  Time   runs      very slow when no  one
| F        G  G#dim7 | Am
  Wants to go  with    you
            Ab+5  | Ebdim7  Ab (6 /4)
  And that's nothing new


#Chorus
| Dbmaj7  | Ebm  | Ebm7/A Ab   | Dbmaj7
  I wasn't only    born    to be lonely
| Dbmaj7    | Ebm    | Ab   Abaug | Ebm  Ab Ab/Bb Ab/C
  I need a new love To keep me   alive
| Dbmaj7   | Ebm       | Ebm7/A Ab   | Dbmaj7
  No use in crying out, I      now am finding out
| Dbmaj7   | Ebm     | Ebm7/A Ab   | Dbmaj7 (4/4)
  Show me a true heart,  give  me  a  sign
