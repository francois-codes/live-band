#Verse 1
D                          Am
  Now they're planning the crime of the century
C      G             F     FaddB   FaddG  F
  Well what would it be?
D                      Am
  Read all about their schemes and adventuring
C            G          F   FaddB  FaddG
   It's well worth the fee
   F           Am    D   Bm
So roll up and see
            C                  Am    D   Bm
   As they rape the universe
                      C             Am
How they've gone from bad to worse


D                       Am
   Who are these men of lust, greed and glory?
C              G               F    FaddB   FaddG   F
  Rip off the masks and let's see
D                           Am
  But that's not right - oh no, what's the story?
C                G               F    FaddB   FaddG  F
   Look! There's you and there's me
