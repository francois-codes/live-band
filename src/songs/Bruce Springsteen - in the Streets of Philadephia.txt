#Intro
F   Am

#Verse 1
     F
I was  bruised and battered I couldn't tell what I felt
     Am
I was  unrecognizable to myself
      F
saw my  reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
          Am
oh brother  are you gonna leave me wasting like this on the
             Bb           F/A      C
streets of Philadelphia
Bb  F/A  C


        F
I walked  the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
       Am
I heard  voices of friends vanished and gone
          F
At night I  hear the blood in my veins
       Am
just as  black and whispery as the rain on the
             Bb            F/A     C
streets of Philadelphia
Bb  F/A  C


#Chorus
Bb                        Dm
Ain't no angel gonna greet me
Bb                         F
  It's just you and I my friend
Am                         Bb         C
  and my clothes don't fit me no more   I walked a
%
thousand miles just to slip this skin

#Verse 2
F
The night is falling, I'm lying awake
     Am
I can  feel my self fading away
    F
so receive me brother with your fateless kiss or
       Am
will we  leave each other alone like this on the
             Bb            F/A     C
streets of Philadelphia...

#Outro
Bb     F/A    C
