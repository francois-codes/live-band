#Intro
|A     | E    | Bm    | D    | (2x)

#verse 1
A                   E
  Pick up the pieces  and pack your mind
Bm                                    D
  You don't ask for what you have to find
A            E
  Many people  rolling out to sea
Bm                                       D
  Let loose those floodgates that have held you back so long

#chorus
A    F#m   A                 F#m                   
 Oh, Lord,   there ain't no end
E            D                A
Left in one thing you tried to kill

#verse 1
A                      E
 Now there’s a station    not so far away
Bm               D
  I listen in   most every single night
A                     E
 Why does that valley   I can’t cross
Bm                                  D
  This soul’s been misplaced in the desert it was lost

#chorus (2x)
A    F#m   A                 F#m                   
 Oh, Lord,   there ain't no end
E            D                A
Left in one thing you tried to kill
