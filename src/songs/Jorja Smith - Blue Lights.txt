I wanna turn those blue lights into strobe lights

Not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
     Abmaj7 Bb          Cm     Bb
Those blue lights into strobe lights
           Abmaj7 Bb               Cm       Bb

#Verse 1
          Abmaj7       Bb6                 Cm    Bb6
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
Bb6
When you hear the sirens coming
    Abmaj7           Cm                                   Bb    Gm
You better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
%
What have you done?
Abmaj7                     Cm
You went to school that day
          Bb                Gm
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
           Abmaj7               Cm
Kept after class for answering back
           Bb               Gm            Ab
You apologized, where's the harm in that


#Chorus
Abmaj7
What have you done?
                 Cm    Bb
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run
                      Gm                                  Ab
(Not blue flashing lights)If you've done nothing wrong
%
Blue lights should just pass you by (maybe even fairy lights)

#Verse 2
Abmaj7      Cm
Gun crime into your right and
          Abmaj7             Bb
Drugs and violence into your left
              Abmaj7          Cm
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
             Abmaj7    Bb
Subconscious waves you accept
       Abmaj7                 Cm
You're sitting on the 4 back home
               Bb             Ab
"Where you at, G? Answer your phone!"
                               Cm
Pause the poison to answer his message
                Bb                       Ab
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence


#Chorus
Abmaj7
What have you done?
                 Cm    Bb
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run
                      Gm                                  Ab
(Not blue flashing lights)If you've done nothing wrong
Abmaj7
Blue lights should just pass you by (maybe even fairy lights)

#Verse 3
Abmaj7             Cm
Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
       Bb                  Gm
Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
        Abmaj7            Cm
But the face of your boy casts a darker picture
       Bb                   Gm
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
      Abmaj7                        Cm
"Look blud I'm sorry 'cause I know you got my back
       Bb                         Gm
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that"
    Abmaj7            Cm
Not long ago you were miming to the "Shook Ones"
         Bb                 Gm
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one

      Abmaj7               Cm
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
     Bb                 Gm
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
           Abmaj7                Cm
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
            Bb
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
        Ab
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from


#Bridge
           Abmaj7                 Cm             Bb
You better run when you hear the sirens coming
                  Gm
When you hear the sirens coming
       Abmaj7                 Cm                Bb
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
                    Gm
'Cause they will be coming for you

Abmaj7                 Cm
Run when you hear the sirens coming
       Bb                    Ab
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
                         Cm
When you hear the sirens coming
                    Bb
The blue lights are coming for you


#Chorus
Abmaj7
What have you done?
                 Cm    Bb
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run
                      Gm                                  Ab
(Not blue flashing lights)If you've done nothing wrong
                                 Cm                    Bb
Blue lights should just pass you by (maybe even fairy lights)
