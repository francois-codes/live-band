#Verse
Bbmaj7                      A7
I thought i had it all together
BbMaj7   Am7   Gm7
But i was led astray
    Bbmaj7  Am7     Gm7
The day you walked away
Bbmaj7                            A7
You were the clock that was ticking in my heart
Dm7     Am7    Dm7
Changed my state of mind
Dm7    Am7     Bm7b5
But love's so hard to find

Bbmaj7                      A7
Your feelings changed like the weather
Bbmaj7  Am7   Gm7
Went from clear to grey
Bbmaj7 Am7   Gm7
On that cloudy day
Bbmaj7          A7
How can i go on without falling apart
Dm7       Am7    Dm7
Love's so hard to find
Dm7      Am7      Dm7
When someone's on your mind

#Chorus
       Dm7 - C - Dm7
Listen baby
     Gm7   Am7       Dm7 - C - Dm7
Your wish is my command
     Gm7       Am7       Dm7 - C - Dm7
Baby won't you understand
          Bbmaj7   Bm7b5    Bb/C
That your wish is my command
                 Cmaj7
What can I do to make my baby understand

#Verse
 Bbmaj7                A7
Something tells me I'm dreaming
BbMaj7   Am7   Gm7
I can see us there
 Bbmaj7  Am7     Gm7
Waving unaware
 Bbmaj7                            A7
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Dm7     Am7    Dm7
Keep the truth confined
Dm7    Am7     Bm7b5
Far from our minds

Bbmaj7                      A7
You need someone you can believe in
Bbmaj7  Am7   Gm7
This i do declare
Bbmaj7 Am7   Gm7
Trust me i'll be there
Bbmaj7             A7
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
Dm7       Am7    Dm7
I will help you climb
Dm7      Am7      Dm7
Change your state of mind


#Chorus
        Dm7 - C - Dm7
Listen baby
     Gm7   Am7       Dm7 - C - Dm7
Your wish is my command
      Gm7       Am7       Dm7 - C - Dm7
Baby won't you understand
          Bbmaj7   Bm7b5    Bb/C
That your wish is my command
                Cmaj7 x7
What can I do to make my baby understand

Baby won't you understand
          G#m     Bbm7      B
That your wish is my command
                 Cmaj7 x7
What can i do to make my baby understand.
