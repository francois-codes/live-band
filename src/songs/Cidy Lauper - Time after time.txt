#Verse 1
Dm    C     Dm    C        Dm    C
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
    Dm       C
and think of you
Dm     C     Dm  C      Dm C
Caught up in circles confusion,
   Dm      C
is nothing new
F    G    Em   F
Flashback warm nights;
  G           Em
almost left behind
F   G       Em   F
Suitcase of memories,
     G
time after . .  

#verse 2
Dm  C         Dm      C
Sometimes you picture me,
    Dm  C       Dm   C
I'm walking too far ahead
Dm     C       Dm C     Dm    C
You're calling to me, I can't hear,
     Dm     C
what you ve said
     F   G   Em F
Then you say go slow;
  G      Em
I fall behind
    F  G   Em     F
The second hand unwinds

#chorus
          G                              Am
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
F    G     C
time after time
       G                             Am
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting;
F    G     C
time after time
          G                              Am
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
F    G     C
time after time
       G                               Am
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting;
F    G     C
time after time

#interlude
| F      | G     | Em     | F     | 2x

#verse 3
Dm C     Dm      C         Dm  C
After my picture fades and darkness has,
Dm        C
turned to gray
Dm   C           Dm C           Dm    C
Watching through windows you're wondering,
   Dm   C
if I'm OK
F   G   Em F  G            Em
Secrets stolen from deep inside;
    F    G     Em     F
the drum beats out of time

#chorus
          G                              Am
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
F    G     C
time after time
       G                             Am
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting;
F    G     C
time after time

#interlude
| G   | Am   | F  G   | C    | 2x

#bridge
F   G   Em F
You say go slow;
  G      Em
I fall behind
    F  G   Em     F
The second hand unwinds

#chorus
          G                              Am
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
F    G     C
time after time
       G                               Am
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting;
F    G     C
time after time

          G                              Am
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
F    G     C
time after time
       G                               Am
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting;
F    G     C
time after time
