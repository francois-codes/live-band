Stars shining bright above you
C     E7              A          A7          
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you
F                    Fm
Birds singing in the Sycamore tree

Dream a little dream of me

Say nightie-night and kiss me
C    E7                A              A7          
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me

While I'm alone and blue as can be
C              Ab    G  C     E7
Dream a little dream of me

A     F#m        Bm       E        A     F#m          Bm   E
Stars fading but I linger on dear, still craving your kiss
A   F#m        Bm          E          A    F#m    Ab    G             
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear, just saying this


#Verse 3
C     B7                   Ab   G
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
C     E7                    A         A7          
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
F                  Fm
But in your dreams whatever they be
C              Ab    G  C     E7
Dream a little dream of me
