#Verse
          Gm7b5     C7
There's a moon over Bourbon Street
Fm      Fm/C  Fm
Tonight
      Gm7b5        C7
I see faces as they pass beneath the
Fm   Fm/E  Fm/Eb  Fm/D
Pale lamp light
        Db            C7
I've no choice but to follow
     Fm  Fm/G  Fm/Ab  Fm/C
That call
    Dm7b5              G7
The bright lights, the people,
        Db       C7
And the moon and all

  Gm7b5      C7
I pray every day
      Fm  Fm/G  Fm/Ab  Fm/C
To be strong
      Gm7b5      C7
For I know what I do
        Fm   Fm/E  Fm/Eb  Fm/D
Must be wrong
          Db           C7
Oh you'll never see my shade
            Fm
Or hear the sound of my feet
                Db        C7      Fm
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

#Verse 2
       Gm7b5         C7b9
It was many years ago
     Fm       Fm/E   Fm/Eb  Fm/D
That I became what I am
      Gm7b5               C7
I was trapped in this life
        Fm       Fm/G  Fm/Ab  Fm/C
Like an innocent lamb
      Db            C7
Now I never show my face
   Fm  Fm/G  Fm/Ab  Fm
At noon
    Dm7b5              G7
And you'll only see me walking
       Db           C7
By the light of the moon

    Gm7b5      C7
The brim of my hat
          Fm  Fm/G  Fm/Ab  Fm
Hides the eye  of a beast
         Gm7b5     C7
I've the face of a sinner
        Fm    Fm/E  Fm/Eb  Fm/D
But the hands of a priest
          Db           C7
Oh you'll never see my shade
            Fm          Fm/E  Fm/Eb  Fm/D
Or hear the sound of my feet
                Db        C7      Fm
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

#Verse 3
    Gm7b5         C7b9
She walks everyday
            Fm       Fm/E   Fm/Eb  Fm/D
Through the streets of New Orleans
      Gm7b5               C7
She's innocent and young
        Fm       Fm/C  Fm  Fm/C
From a family of means
       Db         C7
I have stood many times
            Fm        Fm/C  Fm  Fm/C
Outside her window at night
    Dm7b5                    G7
To struggle with my instinct
       Db            C7
in the pale moonlight

    Gm7b5           C7
How could I be this way
          Fm  Fm/G  Fm/Ab  Fm
when I pray to god above
       Gm7b5           C7
I must love what I destroy
        Fm      Fm/E    Fm/Eb  Fm/D
and destroy the thing I love
          Db           C7
Oh you'll never see my shade
            Fm          Fm/E  Fm/Eb  Fm/D
Or hear the sound of my feet
                Db        C7      Fm
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street
