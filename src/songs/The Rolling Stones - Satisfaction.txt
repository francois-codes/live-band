and he's tellin' me more and more
 A         E       A    D
about some useless information
A           E        A    D
supposed to drive my imagination.

how white my shirts can be.
A      E          A             D       A
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
    E        A         D
the same cigarettes as me.

and I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
        E         A         D
and I'm tryin' to make some girl
    A        E           A         D          A
who tells me baby better come back later next week
           E       A  D      A
'cause you see I'm on losing streak.
