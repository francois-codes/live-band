#verse 1
  Gm
We all came out to Montreux on the
      F     Gm
Lake Geneva shoreline
  Gm
To make records with a mobile
      F     Gm
We didn't have much time

  Gm
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
      F     Gm
Were at the best place around
  Gm
But some stupid with a flare gun
      F     Gm
Burned the place to the ground

#chorus
  C         Ab         Gm
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
  C         Ab
Smoke on the water

#verse 2
  Gm
They burned down the gambling house
      F     Gm
It died with an awful sound
  Gm
The funky Claude was running in and out
      F     Gm
Pulling kids outa the ground

  Gm
When it all was over
      F     Gm
We had to find another place
  Gm
But Swiss time was running out
      F     Gm
It seemed that we would lose the race

#chorus
  C         Ab         Gm
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
  C         Ab
Smoke on the water

#verse 3
Gm
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
F     Gm
It was empty cold and bare
             Gm
But with the Rolling truck Stones Thing just outside
F     Gm
Making our music there

Gm
With a few red lights and a few old beds
F     Gm
We make a place to sweat
Gm
No matter what we get out of this
F     Gm
I know we'll never forget

#chorus
  C         Ab         Gm
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
  C         Ab
Smoke on the water
