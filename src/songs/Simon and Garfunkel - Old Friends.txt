#Verse 1
Amaj7 Emaj7  Amaj7 Emaj7
Old friends, Old friends
F#m7          B              E       C#m
Sat on their park bench like bookends

B
A newspaper blown through the grass
             C#m
Falls on the round toes
       C#m/B
Of the high shoes
       Amaj7 G#m7
Of the old friends

Amaj7 Emaj7
Old friends
F#m7    B
Winter companions
   Amaj7 G#m7
The old men

F#m7          B
Lost in their overcoats
E               C#m
Waiting for the sunset
B
The sounds of the city
                C#m
Sifting through trees
             B
Settle like dust
          A
On the shoulders
       F#m7 C#m
Of the old friends


#Bridge
F#m7       B
Can you imagine us
Emaj7
Years from today
F#m7       B7         Emaj7
Sharing a park bench quietly?
     F#m7      B
How terribly strange
        C#sus4
To be seventy

F#m7     B         F#m7 G#m7
Memory brushes the same years
F#m7     B7           E   C#m
Silently sharing the same fears
