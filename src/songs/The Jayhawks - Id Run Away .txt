NC              Dm       F
I could take a hint from you
        Dm                       F
I could take a little hint from you
              Bb
And I'd run away
Bb/A      Bb/G           F   
   I'd run away with you baby

                    Dm        F
You said a couple things to me
              Dm                            F
You said a couple things that showed your place
             Bb   Bb/A           Bb/G           F   
But how may ways,     how many ways can I say it

Yeah, how many ways,   how many ways can I say it


#chorus
C           Gm
So we had a little baby boy
       Bb                        C
But we knew it wouldn't last too long
C       Gm
Kind of what I had in mind
   Bb                      C      NC
But what I had in mind was wrong

I recall a different side of you
             Bb   Bb/A           Bb/G           F   
But I'd run away,   I'd run away with you baby

I'd run away,     I'd run away with you baby
