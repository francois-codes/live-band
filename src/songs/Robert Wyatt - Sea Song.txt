#Verse
                         F#m
You look different every time
    F             Am           Em
You come from the foam-crested brine
          F#m           F            Am  Em
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight
       F#m          F                Am         Em
Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale
     F#m            F       Am   Em
Am I yours? Are you mine to play with?

F#m      F
Joking apart
             Am             Em
When you're drunk you're terrific
            F#m              F
When you're drunk I like you mostly
        Am                   Em
Late at night, you're quite alright

      Ebmaj7      Cm7                 Bbmaj7
But I can't understand the different you
       Ebmaj7            Cm  Cm7 Cm6
In the morning when it's time to play
                     D
At being human for a while
       E7b5
Please smile

#Verse
                           F#m       F
You'll be different in the spring, I know
         Am       Em
You're a seasonal beast
         F#m            F                Am             Em
Like the starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide
   F#m        F             Am                 Em
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon
     F#m             F              Am           Em
Your madness fits in nicely with my own, with my own
     F#m         F              Am
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own
F        Am
My very own

#instrumental

We're not alone
