#Intro:
G


#verse (guitar + bass)
G                              Em
They say you gave him up for dead
G                               F#
Now there's a stranger in your head
Am
Yellow roses at your feet
                             D
Disappear in a memory of a dream

#verse (tutti)
G                             Em
And like a flower in the Spring
G                             F#
Left to the mercy of the seasons
Am
Soon the past will catch you up, Stinging like a paper cut
F                                   D
There's only so much in your veins to bleed

#chorus
C                                Am
Don't let the world get in your way
C                               Em
Don't let the world get in your way
Am               Em   Am           D
Make your mistakes,   Go on your way

#instrumental
G     | Em    | G     | F#    |

Am
Yellow roses at your feet disappear into a dream
D
Fingers clench and smell of magazines
Am
Kneeling at the altar in a church, Praying desperately
F                                D
That someone up there is listening

#chorus
C                                Am
Don't let the world get in your way
C                               Em
Don't let the world get in your way
Am               Em
Make your mistakes
Am           Em
Go on your way

#outro
C                                Am
Don't let the world get in your way

(Repeat to fade)
