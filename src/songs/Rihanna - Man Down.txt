#Intro
F#m
Uh, Uh


#Verse
       F#m             D
Take a breath, take it deep
         Bm               C#7
Calm yourself, he says to me
       F#m                D
If you play, you play for keeps
         Bm                C#7
Take the gun, and count to three
             F#m         D
I'm sweating now, moving slow
           Bm                C#7
No time to think, my turn to go


#Chorus
                   F#m   D
And you can see my heart beating
E                         Bm
You can see it through my chest
              F#m               D
Said I'm terrified. but I'm not leaving
  E                               Bm
I know that I must must pass this test
C#7              F#m
So just pull the trigger


#Verse
      F#m           D
Say a prayer, to yourself
                   Bm                 C#7
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
           F#m          D
And then I get, a scary thought
          Bm                     C#7
That he's here, means he's never lost


#Chorus
                   F#m   D
And you can see my heart beating
E                         Bm
You can see it through my chest
              F#m               D
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
  E                               Bm
I know that I must must pass this test
C#7              D
So just pull the trigger


#Verse
           A
As my life flashes before my eyes
    Bm                    F#m         E
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise?
D                      B/D#
 So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
         E                                    Fdim
But it's too late too pick up the value of my life


#Chorus
                   F#m   D
And you can see my heart beating
E                         Bm
You can see it through my chest
              F#m               D
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
  E                               Bm
I know that I must must pass this test

                   F#m   D
And you can see my heart beating
E                         Bm
You can see it through my chest
              F#m               D
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
  E                               Bm
I know that I must must pass this test
C#7              F#m
So just pull the trigger
