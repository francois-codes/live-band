#verse
Bb
I'm sittin in a railway station
      F    Ab  G
Got a ticket for my destination
Cm
On a tour of one night stands
   Ab
My suitcase and guitar in hand
    Bb
And every stop is neatly planned
      F
For a poet and a one man band

#CHORUS
Bb        Eb               Bb             Eb
Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound
Bb              Ab         Eb
Home, where my thoughts escaping
Bb              Ab       Eb
Home, where my music's playing
Bb              Ab         Eb
Home, where my love lies waiting
F        Bb
Silently for me

#verse
Bb
Every day's an endless stream
   F       Ab      G
Of cigarettes and magazines
    Cm
And each town looks the same to me
    Ab
The movies and the factories
    Bb
And every stranger's face I see
  F
Reminds me that I long to be


#CHORUS
Bb        Eb               Bb             Eb
Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound
Bb              Ab         Eb
Home, where my thoughts escaping
Bb              Ab       Eb
Home, where my music's playing
Bb              Ab         Eb
Home, where my love lies waiting
F        Bb
Silently for me

#verse
Bb
Tonight I'll sing my songs again
     F         Ab G
I'll play the game and pretend
    Cm
But all my words come back to me
   Ab
In shades of mediocrity
     Bb
Like emptyness in harmony
  F
I need someone to comfort me.

#CHORUS
Bb        Eb               Bb             Eb
Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound
Bb              Ab         Eb
Home, where my thoughts escaping
Bb              Ab       Eb
Home, where my music's playing
Bb              Ab         Eb
Home, where my love lies waiting
F        Bb
Silently for me
F    Bb        Bb  Ab  Eb  Bb
Silently for me ...
