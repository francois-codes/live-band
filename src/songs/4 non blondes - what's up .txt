#Intro
A      Bm       D       A           (x2)


#Verse 1
A
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Bm
Trying to get up that great big hill
   D               A
Of hope for a destination

A
I realized quickly when I knew I should
         Bm
That the world was made of this brotherhood
   D                      A
Of man, for whatever that means

#Pre-Chorus
         A
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Bm
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
      D                         A
and I - I am feeling a little peculiar

         A
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Bm
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  D                                           A
I scream at the top of my lungs "What's going on?"

#Chorus
            A           Bm
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        D                 A
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
            A           Bm
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        D                 A
I said "Hey, what's going on?"

#Interlude
A     Bm  D   A
Ooh, Ooh Ooh
A     Bm  D   A
Ooh, Ooh Ooh

#Verse
      A                   Bm
And I try, oh my God do I try
              D                  A
I try all the time, in this institution
      A                    Bm
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
                    D
I pray every single day
          A
For a revolution

#Pre-Chorus
         A
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Bm
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
      D                         A
and I - I am feeling a little peculiar

         A
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Bm
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  D                                           A
I scream at the top of my lungs "What's going on?"

#Chorus
            A           Bm
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        D                 A
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
            A           Bm
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        D                 A
I said "Hey, what's going on?"

#Chorus
            A           Bm
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        D                 A
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
            A           Bm
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey HeyeYEYEYE"
        D                 A
I said "Hey, what's going on?"

Twenty-five years and my life is still
Bm                                      D
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
           A
For a destination
