#Verse 1
Cm           Dm Dm7-5        Cm
Look into my eyes and you'll see
         Fm7  Cm  B
I'm  the only one
       Bdim        Cm
You've captured my love
Bdim      Cm
Stolen my heart
Bb         Eb
Changed my life

#chorus
Fm7                  Bb7
Everytime you make a move
               Eb/G
You destroy my mind
                Gbdim7
And the way you touch
          Fm7             Fm
I lose control and shiver deep inside
N.C.               Cm Cm7
You take my breath away.

#Verse 2
Cm       Dm Dm7-5    Cm
You can reduce me to tears
       Fm7   Cm    B
With a single sigh
      Bdim           Cm
Every breath that you take -
    Bdim           Cm
Any sound that you make
     Bb            Eb
Is a whisper in my ear

#chorus
Fm7                    Bb7
I could give up all my life
             Eb/G
for just one kiss
          Gbdim7
I would surely die
          Fm7               Fm
If you dismiss me from your love
N.C.              Cm  Cm7
You take my breath away.

#outro
                Bb    Ab/Bb
So please don't go
      Bb            Ab/Bb    Bb
Don't leave me here all by myself
              Eb
I get ever so lonely from time to time

       Ab
I will find you
C                Fm                   Fm/G
Anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
Abdim                       Eb
Right until the ends of the earth
Eb/G        Gbdim                    Fm7
I'll get no sleep till I find you, to tell you when I found you,
N.C.   Cm7
I Love You.
