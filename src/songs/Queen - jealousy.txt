Oh how wrong can you be?

Oh to fall in love was my very  first mistake

Jealousy you got me somehow
    Bb         Bbsus4
You gave me no warning
     Abm/Bb              Eb
Took me by  surpri-a-a-a-ise

         Db/Eb        Ab
Jealousy you led me on

You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
            Bb          Eb
You had suspicion on my trail

#Chorus
    Dm  Cm  Bb           Eb
How how how all my jealousy
          Dm           Gm
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
        D/F#                       Gm
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

With matters of the heart?

Life is much too short
   F#dim D7        Gm
To while away with tears

If only you could see just what you do  to me

Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Gm       Fm
Jealousy you brought me down
Bb           Bbsus4 Abm/Bb              Eb
You bring me sorrow you cause me pa-a-a-in
              Db/Eb           Ab
Jealousy when will you let go?
               Gm            Cm
Got to hold of my possessive mind
           Bb            Eb
Turned me into a jealous kind

#Chorus
     Dm   Cm   Bb           Eb
How, how, how, all my jealousy
         Dm            Gm
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
        D/F#           Bb           Eb  D Gm
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
           Dm          Gm
But now it matters not if I should live or die
             D/F#                      Gm
Because I'm only left with my own jealousy
