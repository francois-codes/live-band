#Chorus
Fadd9               Bbm                 | F     |
A love like ours is love that's hard to find
Am            F      G    |  C      | Bm  E   |
How could we let it slip away?
Fadd9                 Bbm           | F     |
We've come to far to leave it all behind
Am            F     G        | C     |
How could we end it all this way?
        Em                    Am               Dm           |  Fm     | Fm     |
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret the things we said today
