#Verse
     Am                              Am
The rich man, Poor man, Beggar man, Thief
   Am                 Am
Everyone claim, That them are the chief
     G                 G
The rich man buy, The poor man life
     G                        G
The poor man take away, The beggar mans wife

      Am         Am             Am         Am
Don't cry,  My brothers,  Don't cry,  My sisters
  G                        G
Tears won't change the situation
             G                  G
It's just a form, A form of, Reaction
           Am                Am
So if you step on fire, Fire burn you
 Am                     Am
Play with puppy, Puppy lick your mouth
  G                          G               G
Stand up strong, You got to know where you belong
          G                    G
Said the weak ones now,  Will soon become strong

#Chorus
         C            Dm      C
Hey, Everything will soon be okay
    C          Dm      C
As soon as the war is over
      C               Dm      C
The children will be free to come over
  C                    Dm           C
Singing and dancing, Ready to take over
G            G                    G
Have some faith, Have a little faith,    Yeah, Yeah
