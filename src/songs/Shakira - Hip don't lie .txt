#Bridge (shakira)
Am
Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Am
Half animal, half man
Am
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
Am
But you seem to have a plan

Am
My will and self restraint
Am
Have come to fail now, fail now
Am
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
Am
That's a bit too hard to explain

Am              G
Baila en la calle de noche
                Am
Baila en la calle de dia
                G
Baila en la calle de noche

Baila en la calle de dia
