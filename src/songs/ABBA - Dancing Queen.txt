You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
D              Bm                            A
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the dancing queen

A                               D
Friday night and the lights are low
A                            F#m
Looking out for the place to go
E                         A/E    E              A/E
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
               F#m            E F#m
You come in to look for a king

A                     D
Anybody could be that guy
A                              F#m
Night is young and the music s high
E                  A/E    E             A/E
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
              F#m             E F#m
You re in the mood for a dance
             Bm            E7
And when you get the chance...

#Chorus
            A              D                     A        D
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
A              D                      A        E A
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
E              C#7           F#m                     B7
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
D              Bm                            A
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the dancing queen

#Verse
A                              D
You re a teaser, you turn them on
A                                  F#m
Leave them burning and then you re gone
E               A/E      E           A/E
Looking out for another, anyone will do
              F#m             E F#m
You re in the mood for a dance
Bm           E7
And when you get the chance...

You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
A              D                      A        E A
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
E              C#7           F#m                     B7
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
