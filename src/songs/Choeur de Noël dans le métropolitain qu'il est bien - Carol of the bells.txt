Hark! How the bells, Sweet silver bells,

All seem to say, "Throw cares away."

Christmas is here, Bringing good cheer,  (/add alto : ding, dong)

To young and old, Meek and the bold (ding, dong)
Db                       F-7/C                   
Ding, dong, ding, dong, That is their song, (/add ténor : ding dong)
Bb-7               Fm
With joyful ring, all caroling

Bb-7/Db            F-                    
One seems to hear, Words of good cheer, (/add bass)
Bb-7              F-
From ev'rywhere, Filling the air
Fm                 Fm6
Oh how they pound, Raising the sound,
Fm7                 Fm
O'er hill and dale, Telling their tale
