# Couplet 1
F         Em7            A7                Dm        C
Yesterday,       all my troubles seemed so far away
<Bb    C7                      F(sus4)        F
Now it looks as though they're here    to stay
C/E    Dm7      G7     Bb  F
Oh,    I    believe in yesterday.

# Couplet 2
F        Em7          A7              Dm        C
Suddenly,    I'm not half the man I used to be,
<Bb       C7             F(sus4)        F
There's a shadow hanging over           me.
C/E    Dm7      G7       Bb  F
Oh,    yesterday    came suddenly.

# Refrain
A(sus4)               A7    Dm   C   Bbmaj7
Why                   she   had  to  go
Dm/A        Gm6      C7           F
I don't       know she wouldn't say.
A(sus4)               A7    Dm   C      Bbmaj7
I                     said  something   wrong,
Dm/A        Gm6       C7    F
now I       long for yesterday.

# Couplet 3
F        Em7           A7          Dm             C
Yesterday,   love was such an easy game to play.
<Bb   C7              F(sus4)       F
Now I need a place to hide          away.
C/E    Dm7    G7       Bb  F
Oh,    I    believe in yesterday.

# Refrain

Dm/A             Gm6      C7           F
I don't          know she wouldn't say.
A(sus4)               A7    Dm   C      Bbmaj7
I                     said  something   wrong,
Dm/A             Gm6      C7    F
now I            long for yesterday.
