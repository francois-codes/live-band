#Verse
         D        A                 Bm
I could stay awake just to hear you breathing,
            G                    D
Watch you smile while you are sleeping,
               Em           
While you are far away and dreaming,
          D           A             Bm
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender,
          G                D        Em
I could stay lost in this moment forever,
               F#m              G             A
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure,

#Chorus
    D           A         Em
I don't wanna close my eyes,

I don't wanna fall asleep,
         G
Cause I miss you baby,
       A                       D
And I don't wanna miss a thing,

                   A            Em
Cause even when I dream of you,
%
The sweetest dream will never do,
           G
I still miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing

#Verse
        D           A                  Bm
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating,
       G                        D
And I wondering what you are dreaming,
          Em                   
Wondering if it's me you are seeing,
        D                   A                Bm
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together,
                G             D                  A
I just want to stay with you in this moment forever, forever and ever

                   A            Em
Cause even when I dream of you,

The sweetest dream will never do,
