Dm                       C
 I, I love the colourful clothes she wears,
        Bb                             A7
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair.
Dm                        C
 I... hear the sound of a gentle word,
       Bb                                     A7  C7
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air.

#Chorus

F      Bb       F    Bb
 She's giving me exci-tations.
F    Bb        F       Bb

Dm                            C
 Close my eyes; she's somehow closer now,
Bb                               A7
 Softly smile; I know she must be kind.
Dm              C
 When... I look in her eyes,
         Bb                        A7  C7
She goes with me to a blossom world.

#Chorus
F    Bb        F       Bb
