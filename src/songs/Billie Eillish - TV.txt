#Intro
| G  G/F# | Em    | C   D   | Em     |


#Verse 1
| G            G/F#     |  Em      |
I don't wanna talk right now
| C           D   |  Em     |
I just wanna watch TV
| G              G/F#    | Em
I'll stay in the pool and drown
 | C               D      |  Em
So I don't have to watch you leave

| G          G/F#        | Em
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
| C             D      | Em
Maybe I should get some sleep
| G            G/F#          | Em
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
| C                 D  | Em      |
What's the point of anything?


#Chorus
| C        D      |    G  D     Em
All of my friends are missing again
| C                 D              | Em
That's what happens when you fall in love
  | C              D       | G          D     Em
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
  | C                  D                 |  Em
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love


#Verse 2
| G                  G/F#    |  Em
Don't know where you are right now
| C            D  | Em
Did you see me on TV?
| G              G/F#   | Em
I'll try not to starve myself
| C                 D   |  Em
Just because you're mad at me

  |  G           G/F#     |  Em
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
| C            D     |  Em
What about the plans we made?
  |  G               G/F#       |  Em
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
            |  C           D    | Em
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade


#Chorus
  | C         D        |  G  D     Em
Now all of my friends are missing again
     | C                   D             |  Em
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
 |  C              D      |  G          D  |  Em
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
     |  C                  D                 |  Em
And you tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
   |  C          D      |  G_D_Em   | Em (2/4)
And I don't get along with a-nyone
| C       D             |  Em
    Maybe I'm the problem
    | C     D   |  Em
Maybe Iiiii'm the problem


#Outro
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem

| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem

| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
| C      D      | Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
