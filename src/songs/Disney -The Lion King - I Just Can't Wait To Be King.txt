[Simba] I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!
                    C                                                G
[Zazu]  Well, I've never seen a king of beasts with quite so little hair.

[Simba] I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before!
            C                                               G
        I'm brushing up I'm looking down. I'm working on my roar!
             Am                 G      D
[Zazu]  Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing.

[Simba] Oh I just can't wait to be king!
                       C
        No one saying 'do this,'    [Zazu: Now when I said that I...]
                       Am
        No one saying 'be there,'   [What I meant was the...]
                       D/F#        D
        No one saying 'stop that,'  [But what you don't realize...]
                       G
        No one saying 'see here.'   [Now see here!]
        C       G    Am    C   D
        Free to run around all day, [Well, that's definitley out.]
        C                 D  D7  G
        Free to do it it all my way!

[Zazu]  I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart to heart.
        C                                   G
[Simba] Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start.

[Zazu]  If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out!
                C                         G
        Out of service, out of Africa. I wouldn't hang about.
              Am                             D
        This child is getting wildly out of wing!
              C          D          G
[Simba] Oh I just can't wait to be king!
