#verse 1
D              A
Every night in my dreams,
  G          D    A
I see you, I feel you
D             A           G  A
That is how I know you go on.

D              A
Far across the distance
    G        D     A
and spaces between us
D                A           G  A
you have come to show you go on.

#chorus
Bm    A        G        A
Near, far, wherever you are
    Bm             A             G  A
I believe that the heart does go on.

Bm   A        G        A
Once more you open the door
           Bm         A
and you're here in my heart
       G             D  A   Bm      A      G      A
and my heart will go on and on.


#verse 2
D                 A
Love can touch us one time
    G          D    A
and last for a life time
D             A             G   A
and never let go till we're gone.
D               A
Love was when I loved you
    G           D    A
one true time I hold to
D                A         G  A
in my life we'll always go on.

#chorus
Bm    A        G        A
Near, far, wherever you are
    Bm             A             G  A
I believe that the heart does go on.

Bm   A        G        A
Once more you open the door
           Bm         A
and you're here in my heart
       G             D  A   Bm      A      G      A
and my heart will go on and on.
