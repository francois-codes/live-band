#Verse 1
| Dm
    Winter cityside
| Bb                          | C                         | A
     Crystal bits of snowflakes all around my head and in the wind
| Dm
     I had no illusions
| Bb                    | C                                | A
     That I'd ever find a glimpse of summer's heatwaves in your eyes
| Dm         Bb            | C            Am       | Bb
     You did what you did to me, now it's history I see
          Gm            | A
Here's my comeback on the road again

#Pre-Chorus
| Dm             Bb              | C
     Things will happen while they can
       Am             | Bb                Gm             | A
I will wait here for my man tonight, it's easy when you're big in Japan

#Chorus
                      | Dm     Bb
Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight
       | C       Am            | Bb           Gm           | A
Big in Japan, be tight, big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
       | Dm     Bb             | C                  Am
Big in Japan, alright, pay, then I'll sleep by your side
         | Bb               Gm     | A                          | Dm
Things are easy when you're big in Japan, oh when you're big in Japan

#Verse 2
| Dm
     Neon on my naked skin
| Bb                      | C                       | A
     Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
| Dm                        | Bb
     Shall I stay here at the zoo
                             | C                          | A
  Or should I go and change my point of view for other ugly scenes
| Dm         Bb            | C            Am     | Bb   Gm    | A
     You did what you did to me, now it's history IIIIIIIIIIIII see

#Pre-Chorus
| Dm             Bb              | C
     Things will happen while they can
       Am             | Bb                Gm             | A
I will wait here for my man tonight, it's easy when you're big in Japan
