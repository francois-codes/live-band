#Verse
D                            A
   Tell me now, if you came sneakin' up behind      
Bm                       G
  Would you know me and see behind the smile?    
D                       A
    I can change like colors on a wall    
 Bm                                G
Hopin' no one else will find what lies beneath it all
 G              G  
 I think I hide it, oh, so well

#Chorus
   D                                    G
   Steppin' out,   everyone can see my face    
 G                         D           A               G
   All the things I can't erase in my life, everybody knows         
   D                                       G
   Standin' out,   so you won't forget my name    
G                               D       A            | G   | %   |
   That's the way we play this game of life, everybody knows         

#Verse
D                                 A
 Lookin' through the crowd     I search for someone else    
     Bm                          G
 But every time I turn around, I run into myself    
 D                     A
    Here I stand     consumed by my surroundings
       Bm                  G
 Just another day         of everybody lookin'
  G                               Em              A
 Swore they'd never see me cry   never see me   cry    

#Chorus
 D                                    G
 Steppin' out,   everyone can see my face    
 G                         D           A               G
   All the things I can't erase in my life, everybody knows         
 D                                       G
 Standin' out,   so you won't forget my name    
G                               D       A           |  G     | %     |
   That's the way we play this game of life, everybody knows         

#Bridge
C                G                 D                   A
   You say I'll pay the price        that's a chance that I'll take  
C                 G      |  Em                |
     Though you may think I---'m tellin' lies     
 A                 A
 I just call it gettin' by

#Chorus
 D                                    G
 Steppin' out,   everyone can see my face    
 G                         D           A               G
   All the things I can't erase in my life, everybody knows         
 D                                       G
 Standin' out,   so you won't forget my name    
G                               D       A             G
   That's the way we play this game of life, everybody knows         

#Outro
          D                                        Em                    G
Everybody knows (Everybody knows)  Everybody knows  (I'm just barely Getting by)
          D                                        Em                    G
Everybody knows (Everybody knows)  Everybody knows  (I'm just barely Getting by)
 D                     Em                G
 Everybody knows      I'm just barely getting by
D                    Em               G
 Everybody knows      I'm just barely getting by
  D                  Em              G    D
 Everybody knows     Everybody knows
