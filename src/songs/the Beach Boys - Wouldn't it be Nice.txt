Wouldn't it be nice if we were older,
                Bb              Gm
And we wouldn't have to wait so long?
    C              F
And wouldn't it be nice to live together,
               Bb               Gm  C
In the kind of world where we belong?

Dm7                         Cm
You know it's gonna make it that much better?
Dm7                           Am     Gm   C
When we can say goodnight and stay together

               F
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up,
               Bb              Gm
In the morning when the day is new?
    C            F
And after having spent the day together,
                Bb                    Gm     C
Hold each other close the whole night through?

Dm7                       Cm
What happy times together we'd be spending
Dm7                        Am    Gm    C
I wish that every kiss was never ending
                   F
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
A F#m

Dm          Gm                                  F#m        Bm7
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Dm               Gm                            F#m      Bm7
Maybe then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
            F#m    Bm7
We could be married
                 F#m   C
And then we'd be happy
                   F       F
Oh, wouldn't it be nice

#adagio
Dm7                           Cm
You know it seems the more we talk about it
Dm7                       Am      Gm
It only makes it worse to live without it
         Am    Gm     C
But lets talk about it

Wouldn't it be nice?

Good night, baby

Sleep tight, baby...
