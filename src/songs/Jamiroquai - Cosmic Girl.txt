#Intro
| Em7     | F#m7   B7#5 | Em7     | F#m7   B7#5  |


#Verse
       |  Em7                              |   F#m7          B7#5
I must've died and gone to heaven Cos it was a quarter past eleven
   | Em7                      |  F#m7   B7#5
On a Saturday in nineteen-nighty-nine
     | Em7                               |  F#m7                B7#5
Right across from where I'm standing on the dance floor she was landing
     | Em7                          |  F#m7   B7#5
It was clear that she was from another time

      |  Em7                   |  F#m7           B7#5
Like some baby Barbarella with the stars as her umbrella
   | Em7                       |  F#m7   B7#5
She asked me if I'd like to magnetise
   | Em7                             |  F#m7            B7#5
Do I have to go star-trekking? Cos it's you I should be checking
      | Em7                          |  F#m7   B7#5
So she laser-beamed me with her cosmic eyes


#Chorus
| G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7           | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
        She's just a cosmic girl
           | G#m7  F#m7  | F#m7                | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
From another galaxy          My heart's at zero gravity
                      | G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7        | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
She's from a cosmic world        Putting me in ecstasy
                  | G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7           | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
Transmitting on my frequency        She's cosmic


#Instrumental
| Em7     | F#m7   B7#5 | Em7     | F#m7   B7#5  |

| Em7     | F#m7   B7#5 | Em7     | F#m7   B7#5  |


#Verse 2
  | Em7                          | F#m7              B7#5
I'm scanning all my radars cos she said she's from a quasar
   |  Em7                        | F#m7   B7#5
Forty thousand million light years away
     | Em7                            |  F#m7                 B7#5
It's a distant solar system, I tried to phone but they don't list 'em
   | Em7                          | F#m7   B7#5
So I asked her for a number all the same
       |  Em7                     | F#m7       B7#5
She said, step in my transporter so I can teleport ya'
| Em7                  | F#m7   B7#5
All around my heavenly body
         | Em7                         | F#m7             B7#5
This could be a close encounter I should take care not to flounder
| Em7                    |  F#m7           B7#5
Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty face


#Chorus
| G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7           | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
        She's just a cosmic girl
           | G#m7  F#m7  | F#m7                | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
From another galaxy          My heart's at zero gravity
                      | G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7        | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
She's from a cosmic world        Putting me in ecstasy
                  | G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7           | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
Transmitting on my frequency        She's cosmic


#Bridge (bass / drums / choirs)
| G#m7        F#m7   |    F#m7
Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty face
| B7          C#m7   |   C#m7
Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty face
| G#m7        F#m7   |    F#m7
Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty face
| B7          C#m7   |   C#m7
Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty face


#Outro Chorus
| G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7                  | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
  La-ah  ah        She's just a cosmic girl
           | G#m7  F#m7  | F#m7                | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
From another galaxy          Transmitting on my frequency
               | G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7                          | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
Yeah, come here, for             Can't you be my cosmic woman?
                    | G#m7  F#m7 | F#m7                           | B7  C#m7 |  C#m7
I need you, I want you               to be my cosmic girl for the rest of time
