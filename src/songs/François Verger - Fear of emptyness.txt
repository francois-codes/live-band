Wake up at 12, I m feeling so far
| G7    A7       | D    D7
So far from the crowds
| C            A7              |  G        C
But I take a deep breath, and remind who I am
  | G7   A7   | D     |
Honestly who I am ?

#chorus
| Bm                | Em       Em/D
Fear of emptyness, is it even legit
| G     A7   | C     A7
Fear of being nothing,
| G             A               | F#m         Bm
Finding purpose everyday, that's always in my mind
    | G                A7               | D       | C A7 (2/4)  
Once again I feel like my efforts aren't mine

Be someone else and fit into their mold
| G7    A7       | D    D7
Left me empty and so old
| C             A7     | G               C    |
Stars up in the sky, shining like it's normol
      | G7   A7   | D  D7    |
Please give  me a soul !
