# Couplet 1
    Em                Bm
I'm sitting here in a boring room
     Em                        Bm
It's just another rainy sunday afternoon
    Em                     Bm
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do
    Em                  Bm
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you
    Am                  Bm        | Em     Bm |  Em   NC |
But nothing ever happens   and I wonder

# Couplet 2
    Em             Bm
I'm driving around in my car,
    Em                    Bm
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
    Em                Bm
I'd like to change my point of view
  Em                  Bm
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
    Am                  Bm        | Em     Bm |  Em   NC |
But nothing ever happens, and I wonder

# Refrain
  G             D
I wonder how, I wonder why
Em                              Bm
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
    C              D                    G          D
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
    G               D
I'm turning my head up and down,
    Em                              Bm
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
       C            A                     D          D
And all that I can see is just a another lemon tree

# Couplet 3
    Em              Bm
I'm sitting here, I miss the power
    Em              Bm
I'd like to go out, taking a shower,
    Em                      Bm
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
  Em                   Bm
I feel so tired, put myself to bed,
      Am                  Bm        | Em     Bm |  Em   NC |
Where nothing ever happens, and I wonder

# Couplet 4
    Em                   Bm
I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
Em                   Bm
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
    Am                    Bm        | Em     Bm |  Em   NC |
And everything will happen - and I will wonder

# Refrain
  G             D
I wonder how, I wonder why
Em                              Bm
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
    C              D                    G          D
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
    G               D
I'm turning my head up and down,
    Em                              Bm
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    C              A                     D
And all that I can see is just a another lemon tree
      D
And I wonder, I wonder...


  G             D
I wonder how, I wonder why
Em                              Bm
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
    C              D
And all that I can see
C              D
And all that I can see
                     G
...is just a yellow lemon tree
