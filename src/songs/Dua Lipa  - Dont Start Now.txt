#Intro
Bm                   D      Em
  If you don't wanna see me


#Verse 1
N.C.           Em      Bm
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Gmaj7                    D
Thinking 'bout the way I was
        A          Em        Bm
Did the heartbreak change me, maybe
    Gmaj7                 D  A
But look at where I ended up

        Em                     Bm
I'm all good already, so moved on, it's scary
        Gmaj7                D   A
I'm not where you left me at all, so


#Pre-Chorus 1
Bm                    D                       Em   Gmaj7
   If you don't wanna see me dancin' with somebody
Bm                D                         Em      Gmaj7
   If you wanna believe that anything could stop me


#Chorus 1
           Em             Bm
Don't show up, don't come out
            Gmaj7           D   A
Don't start caring about me now
      Em            Bm
Walk away, you know how
            Gmaj7           D
Don't start caring about me now


#Verse 2
N.C.           Em      Bm
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Gmaj7                      D
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
          A         Em     Bm
Though it took some time to survive you
    Gmaj7               D
I'm better on the other side

        Em                     Bm
I'm all good already, so moved on, it's scary
        Gmaj7                D   A
I'm not where you left me at all, so


#Pre-Chorus 2
Bm                    D                       Em   Gmaj7
   If you don't wanna see me dancin' with somebody
Bm                D                         Em      Gmaj7
   If you wanna believe that anything could stop me


#Chorus 2
           Em             Bm
Don't show up, don't come out
            Gmaj7           D   A
Don't start caring about me now
      Em            Bm
Walk away, you know how
            Gmaj7           D
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)


#Bridge
Em         Bm
   Up, up, don't come out, out, out

  Don't start now (oh)

Em         Bm
   Up, up, don't come out, out

#Pre-Chorus 3
Bm                    D                       Em   Gmaj7

Bm                D                         Em      Gmaj7
   If you wanna believe that anything could stop me


#Chorus 3
           Bm                             D
Don't show up (don't show up), don't come out (don't come out)
            Em              Gmaj7
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
      Bm                        D
Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)
            Em              Gmaj7
Don't start caring about me now (so)


#Outro
Bm         D
   Up, up, don't come out, out, out
Em
Don't show up, don't show up, up
Gmaj7
Walk away, walk away (so)

Bm         D
   Up, up, don't come out, out, out
Em
Don't show up, don't show up, up
Gmaj7
Walk away, walk away, oh
