All By Myself
CÃ©line Dion
A
English pop 90s

#Verse 1
A
When I was young
        Dm        A   Em
I never needed anyone
           F#                Bm   Dm
And makin' love was just for fun
               A   Dm E7
Those days are gone

#Verse 2
A
Livin' alone
           Dm                   A     Em
I think of all the friends I've known
           F#           Bm    Dm
But when I dial the telephone
         A   Dm E7
Nobody's home

#Refrain
A        C#m
All by myself
               Em   F#   Bm      Dm E
Don't wanna be, all by myself anymore
A        C#m
All by myself
                 Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna live, all by myself anymore

#Verse 3
A
Hard to be sure
            Dm          A    Em
Sometimes I feel so insecure
            F#             Bm   Dm
And love so distant and obscure
            A   Dm E7
Remains the cure

#Refrain
A        C#m
All by myself
               Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna be, all by myself anymore
A        C#m
All by myself
                 Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna live, all by myself anymore

#Verse 4
A
When I was young
        Dm        A   Em
I never needed anyone
           F#                Bm   Dm
And makin' love was just for fun
               A   Dm E7
Those days are gone

#Refrain
A        C#m
All by myself
               Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna be, all by myself anymore
A        C#m
All by myself
                 Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna live, all by myself anymore
