G                  B7
Dreams are my reality
                 Em7       A7
The only kind of real fantasy
          C                 D
Illusions are a common thing
  Bm                  Em
I try to live in dreams

A different kind of reality
           C                   D
I dream of loving in the night
    Bm               Em7
And loving seems alright
Am7                 D7   C_G
Although it's only fantasy.

If you do exist, honey don't resist

Show me a new way of loving
Am                      Cm7
Tell me that it's true, show me what to do

Maybe my foolishness has past
    Bm               Em7
And maybe now at last
     Am7                      F_D7
I'll see how a real thing can be.

Perhaps that's my reality.
