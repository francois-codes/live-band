Why, when he was a young warthog
  | Bb        F        C   (N.C.)
When I was a young warthog / Very nice / Thanks
  | Eb                       F
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal

I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thickskinned.
     | Eb              F                   | G

And I got downhearted
       Eb/Bb  Bb
How did you feel? ...ev'ry time that I...

Hey! Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids! / Oh. Sorry
