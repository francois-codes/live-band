#Verse 1
N.C.      F#m                            D
They say, Oh, my God, I see the way you shine
          E                                     C#m
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
              F#m                                  D
You know, you stopped me dead while I was passing by
           E*                               C#m
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

#Pre-Chorus
       F#m                              D
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
             E                 C#m
And oh, my I-I, I-I like your style
         F#m                              D
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry

#Chorus
N.C.      F#m                                            D
So I say dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
         E                                   C#m
I never seen anybody do the things you do before
         F#m                                          D
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay-ay
                  E                              C#m
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

#Verse 2

I said, oh, my God, I see you walking by
         E                                   C#m
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my  eyes
             F#m                                 D
Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life
              E                                    C#m
And you just beg to see me dance just one  more time

#Pre-Chorus
     F#m                             D
Oh, I see you, see you, see you every time
          E                     C#m
And oh, my, I, I, I, I like your style
         F#m                              D
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
           E                                    N.C.
