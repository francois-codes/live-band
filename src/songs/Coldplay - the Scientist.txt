#Verse 1
Dm         Bb                     F
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
                   Fadd9
You don't know how lovely you are
Dm       Bb                   F
I had to find you, tell you I need you
           Fadd9          Dm  
Tell you I set you apart
             Bb                       F
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
            Fadd9              Dm  
Oh let's go back to the start
           Bb                 F
Running in circles, coming up tails
                   Fadd9
Heads on a science apart


#Chorus
Bb                        F
Nobody said it was easy
            Fadd9
It's such a shame for us to part
Bb                        F
Nobody said it was easy
          Fadd9                          Csus4
No one ever said it would be this hard
                       F
Oh take me back to the start


#Verse 2
Dm         Bb                      F
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
             Fadd9
Pulling your puzzles apart
Dm           Bb                   F
Questions of science, science and progress
                Fadd9
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Dm          Bb                     F
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
         Fadd9
Oh and I rush to the start
Dm         Bb                   F
Running in circles, chasing our tails
       Fadd9
Coming back as we are


#Chorus
Bb
  Nobody said it was easy
F             Fsus2
  It's such a shame for us to part
Bb
  Nobody said it was easy
F             C/F              F6/9    C/G Csus4 C
  No one ever said it would be this hard.
N.C.
Oh take me back to the start...
