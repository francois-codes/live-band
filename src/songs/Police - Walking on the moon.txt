I hope my legs don't break

Walking on the moon

We could walk forever

#Verse
Dm7
Walking back from your house
Bb                 C
Walking on the moon
Dm7
Walking back from your house
Bb                 C
Walking on the moon

          Dm7
Feet they hardly touch the ground
Bb                 C
Walking on the moon
       Dm7
My feet don't hardly make no sound
Bb            C             Dm7
Walking on, walking on the moon

#Chorus
     Bb         F    C
Some    may say
               Gm        Bb
I'm wishing my days away
       F    C
No way
                Gm           Bb
And if it's the price I pay

         F    C
Some say
            Gm         Bb
Tomorrow's another day
         F
You stay
  C
I may as well play
