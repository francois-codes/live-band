#Chorus
        F                                    C
Because - when the sun shines, we’ll shine together.
                         G                              Am
Told you I'll be here forever, said I'll always be your friend – took an oath,
                            F                                      C
I’m a stick it out till the end - now that it's raining more than ever,
                                G                                 Am
Know that we’ll still have each other, you can stand under my umbrella.

                           F                     C
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.
             Em                    Am
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.
             F                     C
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.
             Em                    Am
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.


#Verse
      Fmaj7                         C
These fancy things, will never come in between.
                  Em                 Am
You're part of my entity, here for infinity.
                 Fmaj7                             C
When the war has took its part, when the world has dealt its cards.
       Em                           Am
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart.


#Chorus
        F                                    C
Because - when the sun shines, we’ll shine together.
                         G                              Am
Told you I'll be here forever, said I'll always be your friend – took an oath,
                            F                                      C
I’m a stick it out till the end - now that it's raining more than ever,
                             G                                 Am
Know that we still have each other, you can stand under my umbrella.

                           F                     C
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.
             Em                    Am
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.
             F                     C
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.
             Em                    Am
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

#Chorus
        F                                    C

                         Em                             Am
Told you I'll be here forever, said I'll always be your friend – took an oath,
                            F                                      C
I’m a stick it out till the end - now that it's raining more than ever,
                             Em                                Am
Know that we still have each other, you can stand under my umbrella.

Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.
             Em                    Am
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.


#Outro #repeat:
     Fmaj7                            C
It's raining (raining), ooh baby it's raining.

Baby come into me, come into me.
