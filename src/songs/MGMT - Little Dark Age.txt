#Verse 1
F#m6/D#           C#7/E#            F#m
Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
F#m6/D#          C#7/E#            F#m
The ruins of the day painted with a scar
F#m6/D#                   C#7/E#                   F#m
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
F#m6/D#               C#7/E#              F#m
The feelings start to rot, one wink at a time, oh

#Chorus 1
Bm   C#m             A       D         C#m     Bm
  Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
     C#m               A       D     C#m  Bm
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
     C#m             A         D     Bm
When you get out of bed don't end up stranded
  C#                       C#7
Horrified with each stone, on the stage my little dark age

#Verse 2
F#m6/D#               C#7/E#              F#m
Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
F#m6/D#              C#7/E#              F#m
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
F#m6/D#                   C#7/E#              F#m
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
F#m6/D#              C#7/E#            F#m
The humor's not the same coming from denial, oh


#Chorus 2
Bm   C#m        A       D         C#m     Bm
  I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
   C#m               A       D     C#m  Bm
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
    C#m             A       D     Bm
If you get out of bed and find me standing
 C#                    C#7
All alone, open-eyed, burn the page my little dark age

#Chorus 3
Bm   C#m         A        D  C#m          Bm
  I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
     C#m             A          D    C#m  Bm
You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
   C#m           A          D       Bm
If I get out of bed You'll see me standing
  C#                   C#7
all alone, Horrified, On the stage My little dark age


F#m
x4 (until bridge comes in)

#Bridge
F#m6/D#      C#7
Giddy with delight
                  F#m
Seeing what's to come
F#m6/D#         C#7
The image of the dead
                F#m
Dead ends in my mind


#Chorus 4
Bm   C#m              A           D     C#m      Bm
  Policemen swear to god love's seeping from the guns
   C#m                A          D     C#m      Bm
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
     C#m           A         D       Bm
If you get out of bed, come find us heading
  C#                            C#7
For the bridge, bring a stone, all the rage my little dark age


#Chorus 3
Bm   C#m        A       D         C#m     Bm
  I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
   C#m               A       D     C#m  Bm
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
    C#m             A       D     Bm
If you get out of bed and find me standing
 C#                    C#7
All alone, open-eyed, burn the page my little dark age
