#Verse
    F  Bb  F              Gm
An old man  turned ninety-eight   
            F   Bb     F            Gm
He won the lottery and died the next day
       F     Bb         F        Gm
It´s a black fly in your  Chardonnay
       F         Bb         F           Gm
It´s a death row pardon two minutes too late
          F    Bb F               Gm
Isn´t it ironic ... don´t you think


#Chorus
         F   Bb        F       Gm
It´s like rain on your wedding day
            F  Bb            F       Gm
It´s a free ride when you´ve already paid
              F  Bb           F           Gm
It´s the good advice that you just didn´t take
    G#         Eb                 F
Who would´ve thought ... it figures


#Verse
   F        Bb      F         Gm
Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
   F          Bb           F              Gm
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
              F          Bb      F         Gm
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
           F             Bb                    
And as the plane crashed down he thought
F                  Gm
" Well isn´t this nice ... "
              F    Bb F               Gm
And isn´t it ironic ... don´t you think


#Chorus
         F   Bb        F       Gm
It´s like rain on your wedding day
            F  Bb            F       Gm
It´s a free ride when you´ve already paid
              F  Bb           F           Gm
It´s the good advice that you just didn´t take
    G#         Eb                 F
Who would´ve thought ... it figures

Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
                            Ebmaj7                      F
When you think everything´s okay and everything´s going right
     Ebmaj7                 F
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
                                       Ebmaj7                 
You think everything´s gone wrong and everything blows up
         F
In your face


#Verse
  F       Bb             F         Gm
A traffic jam when you´re  already late
     F       Bb           F        Gm
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
          F            Bb                 F         Gm
It´s like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife

                  F        Bb      
It´s meeting the man of my dreams
                     F         Gm
And then meeting his beautiful wife
              F    Bb F               Gm
And isn´t it ironic ... don´t you think
        F     Bb                   F        Gm
A little too ironic ... and yeah I really do think ...


#Chorus
         F   Bb        F       Gm
It´s like rain on your wedding day
            F  Bb            F       Gm
It´s a free ride when you´ve already paid
              F  Bb           F           Gm
It´s the good advice that you just didn´t take
    G#         Eb                 F
Who would´ve thought ... it figures
