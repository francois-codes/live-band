#Verse
B                            Bsus4   B
Deep down Louisiana close to New   Orleans
                                   Bsus4 B
Way back up in the woods among the ever  greens
      E
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
      B                         Bsus4     B
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
    F#                            F#7*      F#
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
             B                           Bsus4     B
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell

#Chorus
B
Go go, Go Johnny go go, Go Johnny go
E
Go, Go Johnny go
B
Go, Go Johnny go
F# F#7         B
Go,Johnny B. Goode

#Verse
   B                             Bsus4 B
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
                               Bsus4    B
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
        E
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
B                                  Bsus4   B
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
F#                           F#7      F#
People passing by they would stop and say
   B                      Bsus4     B
Oh my that little country boy could play

#Chorus
B
Go go, Go Johnny go go, Go Johnny go
E
Go, Go Johnny go
B
Go, Go Johnny go
F# F#7         B
Go,Johnny B. Goode

#Verse
    B                                 Bsus4 B
His mother told him "Someday you will be a  man,
                                Bsus4   B
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
E
Many people coming from miles around
   B                                 Bsus4  B
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
F#                           F#7   F#
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
       B         Bsus4   B
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."

#Chorus
B
Go go, Go Johnny go go, Go Johnny go
E
Go, Go Johnny go
B
Go, Go Johnny go
F# F#7         B
Go,Johnny B. Goode
