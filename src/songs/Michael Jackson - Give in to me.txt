| Em | C Dadd4 | x2


#Verse 1
Em                           C        Dadd4
  She always takes it with a heart of stone
Em                                 C       Dadd4
  'Cause all she does is throws it back to me
Em                              C       Dadd4
  I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Bm                        Am
  Don't try to understand me
            Bm              D
Just simply do the things I say


#Chorus
          Em
Love is a feeling
               C       Dadd4
Give it when I want it
              Em
'Cause I'm on fire
            C    Dadd4
Quench my desire
               Em
Give it when I want it
            C     Dadd4
Talk to me, woman
           Em             C  B
Give in to me, give in to me


#Verse 2
Em                            C       Dadd4
  You always knew just how to make me cry
Em                        C         Dadd4
  And never did I ask you questions why
Em                                 C       Dadd4
  It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Bm                        Am
  Don't try to understand me
            Bm                  D
Because your words just aren't enough


#Chorus
          Em
Love is a feeling
          C      Dadd4
Quench my desire
               Em
Give it when I want It
          C      Dadd4
Taking me higher
          Em
Love is a woman
              C       Dadd4
I don't wanna hear it
           Em             C  B
Give in to me, give in to me


#Bridge
Am                                   G
  You and your friends were laughing at me in town
         Em
But it's okay and it's okay
Am                                G
  You won't be laughing girl when I'm not around
       F
I'll be okay
        B
And I'd, I'd never find
%
Better, a peace of mind, no
