#Verse 1
Abmaj7 | Gmaj7                        |Em7
          Some people live for the fortune
|Am7                              |D9
    Some people live just for the fame
Abmaj7 |Gmaj7                     |G#dim7
          Some people live for the power yeah
|Am7                                 |D9
    Some people live just to play the game


#Pre-Chorus
|Gmaj7       Am7          |Bm7      Am7
Some people think that the physical things
  |Gmaj7  Am7      |Bm7    Cmaj7
Define   what's within
Bm7 Am7  |Gmaj7       Am7
And I've been there before
    |Bm7          Am7
But that life's a bore
   |Gmaj7       Am7    |Bm7
So full of the superficial


#Chorus
            |Cmaj9
Some people want it all
                 |Bm7
But I don't want nothing at all
            |Am7
If it ain't you baby
               |Gmaj7
If I ain't got you baby

Gmaj7 Am7        Dbmaj7  |Cmaj7
Some  people want         diamond rings
               |Bm7
Some just want everything
               Bbm7  |Am7
But everything means nothing
               |Gmaj7
If I ain't got  you


#Verse 2
Abmaj7  |Gmaj7                    |Em7
           Some people search for a fountain
|Am7                     |D9
   That promises forever young (you know)
Abmaj7  |Gmaj7                          G#dim7
          Some people need three dozen roses
|Am7                                    |D9
   And that's the only way to prove you love them


#Pre-Chorus
|Gmaj7       Am7       |Bm7       Am7
Hand me the world on a silver plater
   |Gmaj7  Am7          |Bm7   Cmaj7  Bm7  Am7
And what   good would it be
    |Gmaj7     Am7
With no one to share
    |Bm7        Am7   |Gmaj7 Am7 |Bm7
With no one who truly  cares for  me


#Chorus
           |Cmaj9
Some people want it all
                |Bm7
But I don't want nothing at all
           |Am7
If it ain't you baby
              |Gmaj7
If I ain't got you baby

Some  people want         diamond rings
               |Bm7
Some just want everything
               Bbm7  |Am7
But everything means nothing
               |Gmaj7  Gmaj7  Gmaj7
If I ain't got you    you    you

Gmaj7 Am7 Bm7 |Cmaj9
Some  peo-ple want it all
                |Bm7
But I don't want nothing at all

if I ain't got you with me, baby
