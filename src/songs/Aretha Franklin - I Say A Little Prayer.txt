                                             (say a little prayer for you)

#Verse
F#m                Bm7
    The moment I wake up
             E     Amaj7
Before I put on my makeup (makeup)
   Dmaj7                   C#7
I say a little (prayer for you)
F#m                      D
    And while combing my hair, now,
                    E        Amaj7
And wondering what dress to wear, now, (wear now)
   Dmaj7                  C#7
I say a little (prayer for you)

#Chorus
   D        E            C#m         F#m
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
            Em7/A
and I will love you
   D        E        C#m         F#m
Forever, forever, we never will part
            (E)    D  D/A
Oh, how I'll love you
  D         E              C#m         F#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
            (E)     Bm A
To live without you
      D        D/E        D   C#7          
Would only be heartbreak for me.

#Verse
F#m                Bm7
    I run for the bus, dear,
                E       Amaj7
While riding I think of us, dear,
  Dmaj7                    C#7
I say a little prayer for you.
F#m                    Bm7
    And at work I just take time
                   E       Amaj7
And all through my coffee break-time, (break-time!)
  Dmaj7                   C#7
I say a little prayer for you.

#Chorus
   D        E            C#m         F#m
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
            E
and I will love you
   D        E        C#m         F#m
Forever, forever, we never will part
            E
Oh, how I'll love you
  D         E              C#m         F#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
            E
To live without you
      D D  D  D/E  D/E   D   C#7
Would only be heartbreak for me.    (Nobody but me)

   D        E            C#m         F#m
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
            E
and I will love you
   D        E        C#m         F#m
Forever, forever, we never will part
            E
Oh, how I'll love you
  D         E              C#m         F#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
            E
To live without you
      D D  D  D/E  D/E   D   C#7
Would only be heartbreak for me.    (Ooooh-oo-oo-oooh)

My darling, believe me,
          E
For me there is no onnnnne

But you.  Please love, be true. I'm in love with you.
Amaj7

Say you love me too (this is my prayer) Answer my prayer, baby (answer my prayer)
