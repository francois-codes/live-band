#Intro
F#m7         A           Esus              B7sus  (x4)


#Verse 1
F#m7      A
Today is gonna be the day
             Esus                  B7sus
That they're gonna throw it back to you,
F#m7        A
By now you should of somehow
   Esus                B7sus
Realised what you gotta do.
F#m7                  A       Esus           B7sus
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          Dadd9_Esus_B7sus
About you now.

#Verse 2
F#m7            A
Back beat, the word is on the street
         Esus                 B7sus
That the fire in your heart is out,
F#m7             A
I'm sure you've heard it all before,
        Esus              B7sus
But you never really had a doubt.
F#m7                  A       Esus           B7sus
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          F#m7    A    Esus    B7sus
About you now.

#Bridge
    D                E                F#m
And all the roads we have to walk are winding,
    D                   E                 F#m
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding,
D              E                   A5       /G#     /F#
There are many things that I would like to say to you
      A5         B7sus
But I don't know how.

#Chorus
        Dadd9    F#m7    A
Because maybe,
       F#m7                   Dadd9    F#m7    A
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    F#m7   Dadd9   F#m7    A
And after all,
          F#m7   Dadd9     F#m7     A   Bsus NC
You're my wonderwall.

#Verse 3
F#m7       A
Today was gonna be the day,
            Esus                  B7sus
But they'll never throw it back to you,
F#m7        A
By now you should have somehow
   Esus                    B7sus
Realised what you're not to do.
F#m7                  A       Esus           B7sus
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          F#m7  A  Esus  B7sus
About you now.

#Bridge 2
    D                   E                 F#m
And all the roads that lead you there are winding,
    D                   E                 F#m
And all the lights that light the way are blinding,
D              E                   A5       /G#     /F#
There are many things that I would like to say to you
      A5         B7sus
But I don't know how.

#Chorus 2
        Dadd9_F#m7_A
I said maybe,
       F#m7                   Dadd9_F#m7_A
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    F#m7   Dadd9_F#m7_A
And after all,
          F#m7   Dadd9  F#m7   A    F#m7
You're my wonderwall.

#Chorus 3
        Dadd9    F#m7    A
I said maybe,
       F#m7                   Dadd9    F#m7    A
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    F#m7   Dadd9    F#m7    A
And after all,
          F#m7   Dadd9    F#m7    A   F#m7
You're my wonderwall.

#Outro
        Dadd9    F#m7    A
I said maybe,
       F#m7                   Dadd9    F#m7    A
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
       F#m7                   Dadd9    F#m7    A
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
       F#m7                   Dadd9    F#m7    A   F#m7
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
