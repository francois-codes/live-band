#Intro
A7         D
 There are Jews in the world, there are Buddhists,
          G           A7           D
There are Hindus, and Mormons, and then;
          E7                   A7
There are those that follow Mo-hammed, but;
E7                      A7
 I've never been one of them.

#Verse 1
A7           D
 I'm a Roman Catholic,
      A7                            D
And I have been, since before I was born.
        E7                       A7
And the one thing they say about Catholics, is;
        E7                          A7
They'll take you, as soon as you're warm.

    A7                     D
You don't have to be a six footer;
    A7                         D
You don't have to have a great brain.
    E7                     A7
You don't have to have any clothes on;
         E7                      A7
You're a Catholic the moment dad came, because...

 God needs every-bo-dy's; mine, and mine, and mine.
