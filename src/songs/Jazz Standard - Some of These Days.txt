              A7                         Dm
Some of these days, You're gonna miss me baby
               A7                  Dm
Some of these days, You'll miss my kissing
                D7                            G7
You'll miss my kissing, You're gonna miss my hugging
                      G7                  C7
You're gonna miss me baby, When I'm gone away

                   F            Bb
Oh you'll be so lonely, For me only
                  D7                 Gm
For you know, honey, You've had your way
Bb                 B°  F           D7
And when you leave me, It's gonna grieve me
G7                   C7    F             Bb    F
You're gonna miss me baby, Oh when I'm gone
