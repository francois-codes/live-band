Half past twelve
        Gm
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
      Gm                              Dm
How I hate to spend the evening on my own

Au - tumn winds
        Gm
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
       Gm                               Dm
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
<Bb
There's not a soul out there,
<Gm                Asus   A
No one to hear my pray -  er
