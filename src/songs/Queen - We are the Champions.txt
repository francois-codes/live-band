#Intro
C-        Bb/C        C-        Bb/C

#Verse
              Cm  Gm7/C
  I ve paid my dues
                Cm  Gm7/C
  And time after time
              Cm     Gm7/C
  I ve done my sentence
                 Cm  Gm7/C
  But commited no crime

            Eb  Ab
  And bad mistakes
             Eb  Ab
  I ve made a few
             Eb            Bb/D        Cm
  I ve had my share of sand kicked in my face
     F7          Bb           C
  But I ve come through


#Chorus
 F          Am            Dm  Bb C
  We are the champions, my friend
     F           Am                 Bb  F#o
  And we ll keep on fighting till the end
 Gm                   Bbm           Eo
  We are the champions, we are the champions
 F           Eb/G          Ab6         Bb7     C7sus4
  No time for loosers  cause we are the champions
             Fm7       Gm7/C         Fm7       Gm7/C
  Of the world
Fm7       C7sus4


#Verse
               Cm  Gm7/C
  I ve taken my bows
                Cm  Gm7/C
  And my curtain calls
                Cm
  You brought me fame and fortune
                               Gm7/C
  And everything that goes with it
             Cm  Gm7/C
  I thank you all

                         Eb  Ab
  But it s been no bed of roses
             Eb  Ab
  No pleasure cruise
                 Eb
  I consider it a challenge
                  Bb/D  Cm
  Before the whole human race
     F7            Bb           C
  And I ain't gonna lose

#Chorus
 F          Am            Dm       Bb C
  We are the champions, my friend
     F           Am                 Bb    F#o
  And we ll keep on fighting till the end
 Gm                    Bbm          Eo
  We are the champions, we are the champions
 F           Eb/G          Ab6         Bb7     C7sus4
  No time for loosers  cause we are the champions
