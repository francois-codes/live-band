If i Fell
The Beatles
D
english pop 60s

#Intro
     Ebm
If I fell in love with you
          D
Would you promise to be true
    Db      Bbm
And help me understand
            Ebm
'Cause I've been in love before
    D
And found that love is more
     Em           A
Than just holding hands

#Verse 1
     D     Em   F#m   Fdim7   Em
If I give  my   heart to      you
  A
I must be sure
         D   Em   F#m        Em
From the ve- ry   start that you
      A                | D | Gm A |
Would love me more than her

#Verse 2
     D     Em   F#m     Em7
If I trust in   you, oh please
      A
Don't run and hide
     D    Em    F#m     Em7
If I love you   too, oh please
      A7
Don't hurt my pride like
#Bridge
 D9                             G
 her cause I couldn't stand the pain
    Gm                        D           A7
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

#Verse 3
     D    Em     F#m      Em7
So I hope you'll see that I
      A
Would love to love you
D    Em    F#m      Em7
And  that  she will cry
     A          A7
When she learns we are

#Bridge
 D9                             G
 two cause I couldn't stand the pain
    Gm                        D           A7
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

#Verse 3
     D    Em      F#m      Em7
So I hope you'll  see that I
      A
Would love to love you
D     Em   F#m      Em7
And  that  she will cry
     A                 D
When she learns we are two

#Outro
     Gm               | D | Gm | D
If I fell in love with you
