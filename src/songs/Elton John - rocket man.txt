#Verse 1
Gm7                                |  C  |  C     Csus4 |
 She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Gm7              |  C  |  C     Bb/D |
 Zero hour, nine A.M.
Eb                Bb/D Cm  Eb/Bb           |  F/A    Fsus2 |  F    |
 And I'm gonna be hi-i-igh ... as a kite by then
Gm7                          C         Csus4
 I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
Gm7                   |  Csus4      Bb/D |
   It's lonely out in space
Eb         Bb/D Cm        Eb/Bb | F/A F/C | F    Eb/F |
 On such a ti-i-imeless flight

#Chorus
Bb                                     [ Eb ]
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Eb                                      [ Bb ]
 Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
Bb                                 [ Eb ]
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
Eb          Bb/D      C          Csus4 C
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Eb                                 | Bb        Bbsus4_Bb   |  Eb |
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

Bb                                     [ Eb ]
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Eb                                      [ Bb ]
 Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
Bb                                 [ Eb ]
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
Eb          Bb/D      C          Csus4 4
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Eb                                 | Bb        Bbsus4_Bb   |  Eb    Eb9  |
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

#Verse 2
Gm7                            C               Csus2
 Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids
Gm7                    |  C  |  C     Bb/D |
  In fact it's cold as hell
Eb                  Bb/D     Cm             Eb/Bb        | F/A F/C | F |
 And there's no one there to-o-o raise them ... if you did
Gm7                            C
 And all this science, I don't understand
Gm7                         |  C     C7sus4 |
 It's just my job five days a week
         Eb Bb/D Cm  Eb/Bb       | F/A F/C | F    Eb/F |
A rocket ma-a-a-an,    rocket man

#Chorus

 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Eb                                      [ Bb ]
 Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
Bb                                 [ Eb ]
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
Eb          Bb/D      C          Csus4_C
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man

   And I think it's gonna be a long long time
