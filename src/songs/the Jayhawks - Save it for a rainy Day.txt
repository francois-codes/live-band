#intro
B


#Verse
B                     C#m
Pretty little hairdo, don't do what it used to
E                                                       B       
Can't disguise the living, all the miles that you've been through
B                     C#m
Looking like a train wreck, wearing too mauch make-up
E                                                       B       
The burder that you carry is more than one soul could ever bear

#Chorus
     C#m               E     
(So sad) Don't look so sad Marina
B                       F#
There's another part to play
     C#m               E    
(So sad) Don't look so sad Marina
G#m                  C#   E                   B  
Save it for a rainy day, Save it for a rainy day (Save it for a rainy day)

#Verse
     B                        C#m
You never make your mind up, driving with your eyes shut
E                                                           B
Rough around the edges hoping someone'll come and take you home
B                                C#m
Waiting for a breakthrough, what will you set your mind to
   E                                           B
We stood outside the Chinese restaurant in the rain

#Chorus
  C#m               E     
(So sad) Don't look so sad Marina
B                       F#
There's another part to play
     C#m               E    
(So sad) Don't look so sad Marina
G#m                  C#   E                   B  
Save it for a rainy day, Save it for a rainy day (Save it for a rainy day)
