| Dm/F  | C/E  | Dm7  | G   |


#Verse (keyboards)
C/E          Dm/F           Gsus4         G
 I heard you on the wireless back in Fifty Two
C/E     Dm/F          Gsus4     G
 Lying awake intent at tuning in on you
C/E       Dm/F           Gsus4           G
 If I was young it didn't stop you coming through
 C/E  Dm/F | Gsus4 G |
(Ow-A-ow-a)

#Verse (+kick)
C/E            Dm/F            Gsus4       G
 They took the credit for your second symphony
C/E        Dm/F           Gsus4       G
 Rewritten by machine and new technology
C/E        Dm/F           Gsus4            G
 And now I understand the problems you can see
C/E  Dm/F   Gsus        G
(Ow-a-ow-a)   I met your children
 C/E  Dm/F   Gsus          G
(Ow-a-ow-a)   What did you tell them?

#Chorus (tutti)

Video killed the radio star
C                Fsus2
Video killed the radio star
C        G/B      F/A
Pictures came and broke your heart
Gsus4    Am9
Ow-A-A-A-ow

#Verse
C/E         Dm/F        Gsus4         G
 And now we meet in an abandoned studio
C/E          Dm/F            Gsus4          G
 We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
C/E        Dm/F       Gsus4           G
 And you remember the jingles used to go
 C/E  Dm/F   Gsus          G
(Ow-a-ow-a)   You were the first one
 C/E  Dm/F   Gsus          G
(Ow-a-ow-a)   You were the last one

#Chorus
C                Fsus2
Video killed the radio star
C                Fsus2
Video killed the radio star
C     G/B      F/A
In my mind and in my car
   C       G/B        F/A
We can't rewind we've gone too far
Gsus4    Am9
Ow-A-A-A-ow

Video killed the radio star
C                Fsus2
Video killed the radio star
C     G/B      F/A
In my mind and in my car,
   C       G/B        F/A
We can't rewind we've gone too far
C        G/B      F/A
Pictures came and broke your heart,
C/G     G        F*  Fadd9  Fadd9  (NC)
Put the blame on V   T      R
