#Intro
D  

#Verse
| D       | G             | D          | D          
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
| D       | G           | A       | A
I can see all obstacles in my way
| D        | G              | D            | D
Gone all the dark clouds that had me blind

#Chorus
              | C              | G                        | D        | D
It's gonna be a bright, (bright) bright, (bright) sun shiny day
              | C              | G                        | D        | D
It's gonna be a bright, (bright) bright, (bright) sun shiny day

#Verse
| D         | G             | D
I think I can make it now the pain is gone,
| D      | G               | A
All of the bad feelings have disappeared.
| D       | G                 | D
Here is the rainbow I have been praying for.

#Chorus
              | C              | G                        | D        | D
It's gonna be a bright, (bright) bright, (bright) sun shiny day

#Bridge
| F                                | C
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
| F                                    
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but
| A       | C#m  | G  | C#m  | G   | C   | Bm  | A  | A
     blue skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiies .

I can see clearly now the rain is gone
| D       | G           | A       | A
I can see all obstacles in my way
| D        | G              | D            | D
Gone all the dark clouds that had me blind
