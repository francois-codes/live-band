G          C9    D4-9          C9
  Tampa to Tulsa   just one layover
            Cmaj7   | D4-9   |
Thinkin' it over
G                            C9
  There's a card game in the back seat
D4-9                           C9
  They're throwin' dice in the aisle

        Cmaj7              D4-9
And the driver just smiles   with every mile
     Cmaj7                     D4-9
He's closer to the arms of the woman who loves him

Em         Bm        A             C/B C

Ease my worried mind and take my hand

  Pickin' up nothin' but stock quotes on a   GI's radio
     Cmaj7                 D           D
It's givin' me nothin' but false hopes
Cmaj7                       D           D
  I'm puttin' it all on the line
