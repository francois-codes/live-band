#Intro
| Em    |  A     | Em    |  A     |


#Verse
Bm7                    C#m7
How can I just let you walk away
             Dmaj7            Em7
Just let you leave without a trace,
       G                 C#°/G              F#m  Bm
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh.
           Em-7                           | Asus4   | A7     |
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

Bm7                   C#m7
How can you just walk away from me,
         Dmaj7                  Em7
When all I can do is watch you leave,
            G                   C#°/G
Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain,
    F#m             Bm
And even shared the tears.
           Em-7         G                 | Asus4   | A7     |  
You're the only one who really knew me at all.


#Chorus
                    D/A
So take a look at me now
                      G#°/A
Cause there's just an empty space,
            Bm                   G
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
         Em             A
Just the memory of your face.

          A7         D/A
Oh take a look at me now
                      G#°/A
Cause there's just an empty space,
               Bm            G
And you coming back to me is against the odds,
           Em               |Asus4  | %    |A7    |%    |
And that's what I've got to face.


#Verse
  Bm7                        C#m7
I wish I could just make you turn around,
Dmaj7                  Em7
Turn around and see me cry,
           G              C#°/G
There's so much I need to say to you,
   F#m          Bm
So many reasons why.
           Em7                           | Asus4   | A7     |
You're the only one who really knew me at all.


#Chorus
                    D/A
So take a look at me now
                      G#°/A
Cause there's just an empty space,
            Bm                   G
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
         Em             A
Just the memory of your face.

          A7         D/A
Oh take a look at me now
                      G#°/A
Cause there's just an empty space,
       Bm                        G
But to wait for you, well that's all I can do,
           Em               A
And that's what I've got to face.

            A7         D
Take a good look at me now
                    G#°/A
Cause I'll still be standing here,
               Bm            G
And you coming back to me is against all odds,
         Em                 | Asus4   | A7     |
It's the chance I've got to take


#Outro
| Em    |  A     | Em    |  A     |

A7         Em     A
Take a look at me now.
