Love me or Leave me
Nina Simone

Jazz english 50s

#Verse 1
     Am         Am7          Fmaj7     E7
Say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely
Am             Am7          Fmaj7      E7
   You won't believe me but I love you only
C               C7         D7sus4_G7      C         E_E7
  I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

#Pre-Chorus
    Am            Am7             Fmaj7          E7
You might find the night time the right time for kissing
Am           Am7             Fmaj7    E7
   Night-time is my time for just reminiscing
C             C7           D7sus4_G7       C         E_E7
  Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

#Chorus
A7                                          Dm
  There'll be no one unless that someone is you
G7                             C    B7  E7
  I intend to be independently blue

#Verse 2
      Am         Am7       Fmaj7      E7
Saaay, I want your love, I don't wanna borrow
Am         Am7      Fmaj7       E7
   Have it today to give back tomorrow
C             C7               D7sus4_G7    C         E_E7
  Your love is my love there's no love for nobody else
