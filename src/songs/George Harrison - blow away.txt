#Verse 1
D                 Bm7
Day turned black, sky ripped apart
F#m7                      A7sus4      A7
Rained for a year 'til it dampened my heart
D                        Bm7
 Cracked some leaks, the floorboards caught rot
 F#m7                   A7sus4    A7  | A7sus4  A7 |
About to go down, I had almost forgot

#Chorus
D            Bm      F#m    A7sus4  A7
All I got to do is to,   To love   you
D            Bm        C      G
All I got to be is-ah   Be happy
F#m             Bm
All it's got to take is some
F#m         A
  Warmth to make it
      F          C        | A7sus4     A7 |
Blow away, Blow away, Blow away

#Chorus
D            Bm      F#m    A7sus4  A7
All I got to do is to,   To love   you
D            Bm        C      G
All I got to be is-ah   Be happy
F#m             Bm
All it's got to take is some
F#m         A
  Warmth to make it
      F          C         | G  D | F  C | A7sus4    A7 | A7     |
Blow away, Blow away, Blow away

#Verse 2
D               Bm7
Sky cleared up, day turned to bright
F#m7                    A7sus4           A7
 Closing both eyes, the head filled with light
D                     Bm7
 Hard to remember the state I was in
F#m7              A7sus4      A7  | A7sus4      A7 |
 Instant amnesia, Yang to the Yin

#Chorus
D            Bm      F#m    A7sus4  A7
All I got to do is to,   To love   you
D            Bm        C      G
All I got to be is-ah   Be happy
F#m             Bm
All it's got to take is some
F#m         A
  Warmth to make it
      F          C        | A7sus4     A7 |
Blow away, Blow away, Blow away

#Chorus
D            Bm      F#m    A7sus4  A7
All I got to do is to,   To love   you
D            Bm        C      G
All I got to be is-ah   Be happy
F#m             Bm
All it's got to take is some
F#m         A
  Warmth to make it
      F          C         | G  D | F  C | A7sus4    A7 |  A7 |
Blow away, Blow away, Blow away

#Verse 3
D             Bm7
Wind blew in, cloud was dispersed
F#m7                     A7sus4         A7
 Rainbows appearing, the pressures were burst
D                   Bm7
 Breezes a-singing, now feeling good
F#m7                          A7sus4       A7    | A7sus4   A7 |
 The moment had passed like I knew that it should

#Chorus
D            Bm      F#m    A7sus4  A7
All I got to do is to,   To love   you
D            Bm        C      G
All I got to be is-ah   Be happy
F#m             Bm
All it's got to take is some
F#m         A
  Warmth to make it
      F          C        | A7sus4     A7 |
Blow away, Blow away, Blow away

#Chorus
D            Bm      F#m    A7sus4  A7
All I got to do is to,   To love   you
D            Bm        C      G
All I got to be is-ah   Be happy
F#m             Bm
All it's got to take is some
F#m         A
  Warmth to make it
      F          C         | G  D | F  C | A7sus4    A7 | A7  |
Blow away, Blow away, Blow away

Blow away, Blow away, Blow away             (fade)
