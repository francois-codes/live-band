#Intro
F  F

#Verse
     Am           C
Wake up, put your shoes on
        F                     E
Take a breath of the northern air
                F
And rub those eyes
    Dm                        G
Genuflect beneath the starry skies

  Am                   C
Before you climb the mountain
           F                E
First the foothills must appear
                F
Step high and light
                  Dm                G
And take up your staff and shining armor


#Bridge

(Chin up, chin up)
Em
You don't really have a problem
Fmaj7
(Chin up, chin up)
        Em      G7
In your hour of despair

#chorus
    C                 Em          G
And smile when you're down and out (Find something inside you)
C                  Em          G
Smile when you're down and out (Find something inside you)
F      F
Smile…

#Verse
    Am            C
The stars on the horizon
            F                    E
Stretch as far as the eyes can see
           F        Dm                           G
They represent the souls of those like you and me

#chorus
    C                 Em          G
And smile when you're down and out (Find something inside you)
C                  Em          G
Smile when you're down and out (Find something inside you)
F      F
Smile…
