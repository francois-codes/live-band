#VERSE 1/2
Em               Bm7          Asus2       Bsus4   B7
  He deals the cards,    in a meditation,
Em/C             Bm7          Asus2       Bsus4   B7
  and those who play,   never suspect,
Cmaj7                            Gsus2 G5        B7   
    he doesnt play,      for the mo  - ney he wins,
Cmaj7         Esus2sus4         Em
    he doesnt play    for   respect.

Em               Bm7             Asus2     Bsus4  B7
  He deals the cards looking for answers,
Em/C             Bm7           Asus2      Bsus4   B7
    the sacred geometry of chance,
Cmaj7                        Gsus2  G5    B7       
    a hidden law,       of a pro -  bable outcome,
Cmaj7           Esus2sus4     Em
    the numbers lead   a   dance.


#CHORUS 1
Em                 Bm7                 Asus2        Bsus4 B7
   I know that the spades,    are the swords of a soldier,
Em/C                Bm7                  Asus2      Bsus4 B7
   I know that the clubs are weapons of war,
Cmaj7                             Gsus2 G5            B7
   I know that diamonds,      are mo -  ney for this art,
       Cmaj7         Esus2sus4     Em
   but thats not the shape of my heart.


#VERSE 3
Em             Bm7              Asus2     Bsus4  B7
   And he may play the jack of diamonds,  
Em/C        Bm7              Asus2     Bsus4   B7
   he may lay the queen of spades,
Cmaj7                   Gsus2  G5     B7
   he may conceal,    a king   in his hand,
Cmaj7         Esus2sus4       Em
    while the memory of it fades.


#CHORUS 2
Em                 Bm7                Asus2         Bsus4   B7
   I know that the spades,    are the swords of a soldier,
Em/C               Bm7                  Asus2       Bsus4   B7
   I know that the clubs are weapons of war,
Cmaj7                          Gsus2 G5            B7   
   I know that diamonds,   are mo -  ney for this art,
       Cmaj7         Esus2sus4      Em        Em7     
   but thats not the shape   of my heart,
    Cmaj7         Esus2sus4               (Middle 8 start)
   thats not the shape              of my (heart

#VERSE 4
Em           Bm7              Asus2    Bsus4  B7
   And if I told you that I loved you,
Em/C          Bm7                    Asus2    Bsus4  B7
   you maybe think theres something wrong,
Cmaj7                   Gsus2 G5    B7   
   I'm not a man,    of two   many faces,
Cmaj7         Esus2sus4    Em
   the mask I wear   has   won.

Em                    Bm7         Asus2    Bsus4  B7
   And all those that speak know nothing,
Em/C           Bm7                Asus2    Bsus4  B7
   and they'll find out to their cost,
Cmaj7                                  Gsus2 G5   B&
   and those that curse their luck, in  too  many places,
Cmaj7              Esus2sus4  Em
   are those that fear  are  lost.
