#Verse
C
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time
            Dm7         G Dm7 G
To spend an evening with me
    Dm7         G
And if we go someplace to dance
  Dm7                G
I know that there's a chance
             C
You won't be leaving with me

     C7
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
           F            G#7
And have a drink or two
    Dm7          G
And then I go and spoil it all
   Dm7             G
By saying something stupid
       C
Like I love you


#Bridge
      C7
I can see it in your eyes
                               F
You still despise the same old lines

You heard the night before
    D7
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true
                    G             G7
And never seemed so right before


#Verse 2
  C
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
            Dm7         G  Dm7 G
To make the meaning come true
    Dm7              G             Dm7         G
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
         C
And I'm alone with you

    C7
The time is right your perfume fills my head
                             F               G#7
The stars get red and oh the night's so blue
    Dm7          G
And then I go and spoil it all
   Dm7             G            C
By saying something stupid like I love you


#Interlude
| C    | Dm  G  | Dm  G  | Dm  G  | Dm  G  |


#Verse 3
    C7
The time is right your perfume fills my head
                             F               G#7
The stars get red and oh the night's so blue
    Dm7          G
And then I go and spoil it all
   Dm7             G            C       G#7
By saying something stupid like I love you
  C       G#7
I love you
  C
I love you
