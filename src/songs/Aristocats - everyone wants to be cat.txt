#Verse 1
Em        Em/D         Em/D
Everybody wants to be a cat,
E/C      Cmaj7     Am6/C
because a cat's the only cat
    C7               B7
who knows where it's at.
Em          Em/D              Em/D   Em/C
Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat,
Cmaj7             Bm7     Em         Bm7 / Em
'cause everything else is obsolete.


#Verse 2
Em    Am            Am/G
Now a square with a horn,
Am/G         Am/F
can make you wish you weren't born,
      G
ever'time he plays;
B7
and with a square in the act,
he can set music back
       Em  Am  B7     / C / B7
to the caveman days.


#Verse 3
Em                    Em/D              Em/D
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing,
Em/C Cmaj7          Am6/C
but a cat's the only cat
    C7           B7
who knows how to swing.
    Em
Who wants to dig
a long-haired gig
or stuff like that?
When everybody wants to be a cat.


#Verse 4
Em    Am            Am/G
A square with a horn,
Am/G         Am/F
can make you wish you weren't born,
      G
ever'time he plays;
B7
and with a square in the act,
he can set music back
       Em  Am  B7     /C   /B7
to the Stone Age days.


Em        Em/D         Em/D
Everybody wants to be a cat,
E/C      Cmaj7     Am6/C
because a cat's the only cat
    C7               B7
who knows where it's at.
Em          Em/D              Em/D   Em/C
while playin' jazz you always has a Welcome mat,
Cmaj7             Bm7     Em         Bm7 / Em
'cause everybody digs a swingin' cat.

Everybody digs a swingin' cat.
