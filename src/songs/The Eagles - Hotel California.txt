#Verse
Bm                       F#
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                     E7
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
G                        D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em                                      F#
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night

Bm                             F#
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
A                                            E7
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
G                                  D
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Em                                  F#
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say...

#Chorus:
<G                        D
Welcome to the Hotel California
       F#                                Bm               A/C# D D/F#
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)  Such a lovely face
G                               D
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Em                                         F#
Any time of year (Any time of year) You can find it here


#Verse:
Bm                           F#
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
A                                   E7
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
G                                D
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Em                      F#
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

Bm                           F#
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"
          A                                     E7
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"
G                                       D
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Em                                     F#
Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say...


#Chorus:
G                        D
Welcome to the Hotel California
       F#                                      Bm        A/C#  D  D/F#
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face
G                                  D
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Em                                             F#
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis


#Verse:
Bm                      F#
Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice
              A                               E7
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
G
And in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast
Em
They stab it with their steely knives, But they just can't kill the beast

Bm                           F#
Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door
A                                 E7
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
G                                   D
"Relax, " said the night man, "We are programmed to receive.
Em                                   F#
You can check-out any time you like, But you can never leave! "
