#Verse 1
                Em7
Very superstitious, writing's on the wall,
                %
Very superstitious, ladder's 'bout to fall,
               %
Thirteen month old baby, broke the looking glass,
               %
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past!

#Chorus
               B7        C7
When you believe in things
         B7        Bb7-5          A7sus4_B7+5
That you don't understand then you suffer,
                      Em7      [Riff]
Superstition ain't the way,      yeh -e -yeh!

#Verse 2
                  Em7                         Em7
Ooh, very superstitious, wash your face and hands,
                %
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can,
                %
Keep me in a daydream, keep me going strong,
                %
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song!

#Chorus
               B7        C7
When you believe in things
         B7         Bb7-5          A7sus4_B7+5
That you don't understand then you suffer,
                      Em7      [Riff]
Superstition ain't the way,      yeh -e -yeh!

Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past!
