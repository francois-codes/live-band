#Verse 1
   D            A                  Bm            F#m
I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
G              A               D
We can do the tango, just for two
   D        A               Bm                 F#m
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
 G         A               D
Be a Valentino, just for you


#Chorus
 D   A      Bm  F#m   D   A
"Ooh love, Ooh lover bo---y
             Bm                 F#m
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
 Bm      F#m       Bm      F#m
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
          G                      A             D
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy


#Verse 2
 D                        A
Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
 D  Cm                   F
Oo-ooh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)
                       Bm          F#m
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
             G           A               D
And tell me how do you feel right after-all
                      G          D
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
  G             A              D
Say the word, your wish is my command


#Chorus
    D     A    Bm   F#m D  A
"Ooh love, Ooh lover bo-y
                     Bm            F#m
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
  Bm        F#m    Bm         F#m
Write my letter, feel much better
         G             A             D
And use my fancy patter on the telephone


#Bridge
  D
When I'm not with you
   D
Think of you always
   G    A
I miss you (I miss those long hot summer nights)
  D
When I'm not with you
   F
Think of me always
    G       A
Love you, Love you

  D            A
Hey boy where do you get it from?
  D             A
Hey boy where did you go?
     Bm        F#m           G           A
I learned my passion in the good old fashioned
             D
School of lover boys

Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 o'clock) precisely
 G           A                      D
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
    D             A            Bm                   F#m
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely

What're you doing tonight, hey boy"
     Bm           F#m         Bm       F#m
Everything's all right, just hold on tight
     G                            A                        D
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned (fashioned) lover boy
