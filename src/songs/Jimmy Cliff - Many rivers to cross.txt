english reggae 90s

#Verse
  G              Bm  C
Many rivers to cross
       Bm             C     D    G
But I can't seem to find my way over
  G             Bm  C
Wandering I am lost
        Bm     C         D             G
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

  G              Bm  C
Many rivers to cross
       Bm             C     D    G
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
  G             Bm  C
I've been licked, washed up for years
        Bm     C         D             G
And I merely survived because of my pride


#CHORUS
 C                           G
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
 C                       G
It's such a drag to be on your own
 C                      G   G/F#m Em
My woman left and she didn't say why
 C                      D   N.C.
Well I guess I have to try

#Verse
  G              Bm  C
Many rivers to cross
       Bm             C     D    G
But just where to begin, I'm playing for time
  G             Bm  C
There have been times I find myself
        Bm     C         D             G
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime

  G              Bm  C
Many rivers to cross
       Bm             C     D    G
But I can't seem to find my way over
  G             Bm  C
Wandering I am lost
        Bm     C         D             G
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

  G              Bm  C
Many rivers to cross
       Bm             C     D    G
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
  G             Bm  C
I've been licked, washed up for years
        Bm     C         D             G
And I merely survived because of my pride
