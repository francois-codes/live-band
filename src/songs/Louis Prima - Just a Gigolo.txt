#Verse A
    G                                           Am              D7    
I'm just a gigolo everywhere I go people know the part I'm playing

Paid for every dance selling each romance every night some heart betraying

There will come a day when youth will pass away, what will they say about me
  Am                Cm              G            E7  Am     D7             G
When the end comes I know they'll say just a gigolo, life goes on without me

Won't some sweet mama come and take a chance with me cause I ain't so bad
