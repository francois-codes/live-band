#Verse 1
G          C
My baby don't mess around
             C
Because she loves me so
             D       Em
And this I know for sure

G             C
But does she really wanna
            C
But can't stand to see me
     D        Em
Walk out the door

G               C
Don't try to fight the feeling
             C
'Cause the thought alone
           D         Em
Is killing me right now

G                C
I thank god for mom and dad
              C
For sticking two together
           D          Em
'Cause we don't know how

#Chorus
G        C       D    Em
Heeeey yaaaaa... Hey yaaaaa... (x4)


#Verse 2
G                     C
You think you got it, Oh you think you got it
     C
But got it just don't get it
             D           Em
Till there's nothing at all

G                C
We get together, Oh we get together
     C
But separate's always better
               D         Em
When there's feelings involved

G                     C
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
       C
Then what makes, then what makes,
      D                Em
Then what makes, then what makes, love exception

G                  C
So why you why you why you why you why you
 C
Why you are so in denial
         D               N.C.
When we know we're not happy here...

#Chorus
G        C       D    Em
