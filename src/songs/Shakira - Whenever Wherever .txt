#Vese 1
C#m
Lucky you were born that far away so
G#m
    So we could both make fun of distance
A
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
E                   B
  The lucky fact of your existence

C#m
Baby I would climb the Andes solely
G#m
    To count the freckles on your body
A
Never could imagine there were only
E                   B
   Too many ways to love somebody

F#m
Lo ro lo le lo le
C#m
Lo ro lo le lo le
A                B
Can't you see... I'm at your feet


#Chorus
C#m           A
    Whenever,   wherever
E                  B
    We're meant to be together
C#m               A
I'll be there and you'll be near
F#m                B
    And that's the deal my dear

C#m               A
    They're over,   you're under
E                B
    You'll never have to wonder
C#m           A
We can always play by ear
F#m                B
    But that's the deal my dear

C#m   F#m B x2


#Verse 2
C#m
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
G#m
    They spill kisses like a fountain
A
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
E                      B
  So you don't confuse them with mountains

C#m
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
G#m
    To run for cover when I need it
A
And these two eyes that for no other
E                         B
   The day you leave will cry a river

F#m
Lo ro lo le lo le
C#m
Lo ro lo le lo le
A                B
At your feet...  I'm at your feet


#Chorus
C#m           A
    Whenever,   wherever
E                  B
    We're meant to be together
C#m               A
I'll be there and you'll be near
F#m                B
    And that's the deal my dear
C#m               A
    They're over,   you're under
E                B
    You'll never have to wonder
C#m           A
We can always play by ear
F#m                B
    But that's the deal my dear

Lo ro lo le lo le,   lo ro lo le lo le-e-ee
A             B
sink or fly,  say it again
F#m                       C#m
Lo ro lo le lo le lo le   Tell me one more time

that you'll live   lost in my eyes

C#m               A
    They're over,   you're under
E             B
You've got me head over heels
C#m                 A
    There's nothing left to fear
F#m               B
    if you really feel the way  I  feel

C#m           A
    Whenever,   wherever
E                  B
    We're meant to be together
C#m               A
I'll be there and you'll be near
F#m                B
    And that's the deal my dear

C#m               A
    They're over,   you're under
E             B
You've got me head over heels
C#m                 A
    There's nothing left to fear
F#m               B
    if you really feel the way  I  feel
