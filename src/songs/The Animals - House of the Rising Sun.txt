There is a house in New Orleans,
      Am       C      E7
They call the "Rising Sun",
     Am       C       D           F
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
    Am     E         Am    C    D    F    Am    E7    Am    E7
And God, I know, I'm one.

My mother was a tailor,
      Am       C      E7
She sewed my new blue jeans,
     Am       C       D           F
My father was a gambling man,
    Am     E         Am    C    D    F    Am    E7    Am    E7
Down in New Orleans.

      Am   C        D          F
Now the only thing a gambler needs,
      Am       C      E7
Is a suitcase and a trunk,
     Am       C       D           F
And the only time, he's satisfied,
    Am       E        Am    C    D    F    Am    E7    Am    E7
is when He's on a drunk
