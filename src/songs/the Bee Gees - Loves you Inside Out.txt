Don't try to tell me it's all over

I can't hear a word I can't hear a line

And that's what I'm cryin' for

You can't change the way I feel inside
Gmaj7                     G7/F
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow

Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow

I ain't no vision, I am the man... who...
